        <h2 class="title editable block">Definition of a Crime</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="storm_1.0-ch01_s01_s01_p01">Let’s begin at the beginning by defining a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">crime</a><span class="glossdef">An act committed in violation of a law prohibiting it or omitted in violation of a law ordering it.</span></span>. The most basic definition of a crime is “an act committed in violation of a law prohibiting it, or omitted in violation of a law ordering it.”<span class="footnote" id="storm_1.0-fn01_001">Yourdictionary.com, “Definition of Crime,” accessed August 15, 2010, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.yourdictionary.com/crime">http://www.yourdictionary.com/crime</a>.</span> You learn about criminal act and omission to act in <a class="xref" href="storm_1.0-ch04#storm_1.0-ch04">Chapter 4 "The Elements of a Crime"</a>. For now, it is important to understand that criminal act, omission to act, and criminal intent are <strong class="emphasis bold">elements</strong> or parts of every crime. <strong class="emphasis bold">Illegality</strong> is also an element of every crime. Generally, the <em class="emphasis">government</em> must enact a <em class="emphasis">criminal law</em> specifying a crime and its elements before it can punish an individual for criminal behavior. Criminal laws are the primary focus of this book. As you slowly start to build your knowledge and understanding of criminal law, you will notice some unique characteristics of the United States’ legal system.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="storm_1.0-ch01_s01_s01_p02">Laws differ significantly from state to state. Throughout the United States, each state and the federal government criminalize different behaviors. Although this plethora of laws makes American legal studies more complicated for teachers and students, the size, cultural makeup, and geographic variety of our country demand this type of legal system.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="storm_1.0-ch01_s01_s01_p03">Laws in a democratic society, unlike laws of nature, are created by <em class="emphasis">people</em> and are founded in religious, cultural, and historical value systems. People from varying backgrounds live in different regions of this country. Thus you will see that different people enact distinct laws that best suit their needs. This book is intended for use in all states. However, the bulk of any criminal law overview is an examination of different crimes and their elements. To be accurate and representative, this book focuses on <em class="emphasis">general</em> principles that <em class="emphasis">many</em> states follow and provides frequent references to specific state laws for illustrative purposes. Always check the most current version of your state’s law because it may vary from the law presented in this book.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="storm_1.0-ch01_s01_s01_p04">Laws are not <em class="emphasis">static</em>. As society changes, so do the laws that govern behavior. Evolving value systems naturally lead to new laws and regulations supporting modern beliefs. Although a certain stability is essential to the enforcement of rules, occasionally the rules must change.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="storm_1.0-ch01_s01_s01_p05">Try to maintain an open mind when reviewing the different and often contradictory laws set forth in this book. Law is not exact, like science or math. Also try to become comfortable with the gray area, rather than viewing situations as black or white.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Example of Criminal Law Issues</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="storm_1.0-ch01_s02_s01_p01">Clara and Linda go on a shopping spree. Linda insists that they browse an expensive department store. Moments after they enter the lingerie department, Linda surreptitiously places a bra in her purse. Clara watches, horrified, but does not say anything, even though a security guard is standing nearby. This example illustrates two issues of criminal law: (1) Which crime did Linda commit when she shoplifted the bra? (2) Did Clara commit a crime when she failed to alert the security guard to Linda’s shoplifting? You learn the answer to issue (1) in <a class="xref" href="storm_1.0-ch11#storm_1.0-ch11">Chapter 11 "Crimes against Property"</a> and issue (2) in <a class="xref" href="storm_1.0-ch04#storm_1.0-ch04">Chapter 4 "The Elements of a Crime"</a> and <a class="xref" href="storm_1.0-ch07#storm_1.0-ch07">Chapter 7 "Parties to Crime"</a>.</p>

Assume that Linda and Clara attempt to leave the store and an alarm is activated. Linda begins sprinting down the street. Colin, a police officer, just happens to be driving by with the window of his patrol car open. He hears the store alarm, sees Linda running, and begins shooting at Linda from the car. Linda is shot in the leg and collapses. Linda is treated at the hospital for her injury, and when she is released, Colin arrests her and transports her to the police station. He brings her to an isolated room and leaves her there alone. Twelve hours later, he reenters the room and begins questioning Linda. Linda immediately requests an attorney. Colin ignores this request and continues to question Linda about the reason the department store alarm went off. Whether Colin properly arrested and interrogated Linda are <strong class="emphasis bold">criminal procedure</strong> issues beyond the scope of this book. However, this example does illustrate one criminal law issue: did Colin <em class="emphasis">commit a crime</em> when he shot Linda in the leg?

    </div>
    <p class="para editable block" id="storm_1.0-ch01_s03_p01">Law can be classified in a variety of ways. One of the most general classifications divides law into civil and criminal. A basic definition of civil law is “the body of law having to do with the private rights of individuals.”<span class="footnote" id="storm_1.0-fn01_002">Yourdictionary.com, “Definition of Civil Law,” accessed August 16, 2010, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.yourdictionary.com/civil-law">http://www.yourdictionary.com/civil-law</a>.</span> As this definition indicates, civil law is between individuals, not <em class="emphasis">the government</em>. Criminal law involves regulations enacted and enforced by government action, while civil law provides a remedy for individuals who need to enforce private rights against other individuals. Some examples of civil law are family law, wills and trusts, and contract law. If individuals need to resolve a <em class="emphasis">civil dispute</em>, this is called <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">civil litigation</a><span class="glossdef">A legal action between individuals to resolve a civil dispute.</span></span>, or a civil lawsuit. When the type of civil litigation involves an injury, the injury action is called a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">tort</a><span class="glossdef">A civil litigation matter that seeks to compensate a victim for an injury.</span></span>.</p>
    <div class="section" id="storm_1.0-ch01_s03_s01">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Characteristics of Civil Litigation</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="storm_1.0-ch01_s03_s01_p01">It is important to distinguish between civil litigation and <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">criminal prosecution</a><span class="glossdef">A legal action where the government prosecutes a defendant to protect the public.</span></span>. Civil and criminal cases share the same courts, but they have very different goals, purposes, and results. Sometimes, one set of facts gives way to a civil lawsuit <em class="emphasis">and</em> a criminal prosecution. This does not violate double jeopardy and is actually quite common.</p>
        <div class="section" id="storm_1.0-ch01_s03_s01_s01">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Parties in Civil Litigation</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="storm_1.0-ch01_s03_s01_s01_p01">In civil litigation, an injured party sues to receive a court-ordered remedy, such as money, property, or some sort of performance. Anyone who is injured—an individual, corporation, or other business entity—can sue civilly. In a civil litigation matter, the injured party that is suing is called the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">plaintiff</a><span class="glossdef">The individual suing in a civil litigation matter.</span></span>. A plaintiff must hire and pay for an attorney or represent himself or herself. Hiring an attorney is one of the many costs of litigation and should be carefully contemplated before jumping into a lawsuit.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="storm_1.0-ch01_s03_s01_s01_p02">The alleged wrongdoer and the person or entity being sued are called the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">defendant</a><span class="glossdef">The alleged wrongdoer in a civil litigation matter and a criminal prosecution.</span></span>. While the term <em class="emphasis">plaintiff</em> is always associated with civil litigation, the wrongdoer is called a defendant in <em class="emphasis">both</em> civil litigation and a criminal prosecution, so this can be confusing. The defendant can be any person or thing that has caused harm, including an individual, corporation, or other business entity. A defendant in a civil litigation matter must hire and pay for an attorney <em class="emphasis">even if that defendant did nothing wrong</em>. The right to a free attorney does not apply in civil litigation, so a defendant who cannot afford an attorney must represent himself or herself.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section" id="storm_1.0-ch01_s03_s01_s02">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Goal of Civil Litigation</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="storm_1.0-ch01_s03_s01_s02_p01">The <em class="emphasis">goal</em> of civil litigation is to <em class="emphasis">compensate the plaintiff</em> for any injuries and to put the plaintiff back in the position that person held before the injury occurred. This goal produces interesting results. It occasionally creates liability or an obligation to pay when there is no fault on behalf of the defendant. The goal is to make the plaintiff whole, not to punish, so <em class="emphasis">fault</em> is not really an issue. If the defendant has the resources to pay, sometimes the law requires the defendant to pay so that society does not bear the cost of the plaintiff’s injury.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="storm_1.0-ch01_s03_s01_s02_p02">A defendant may be liable without fault in two situations. First, the law that the defendant violated may not require fault. Usually, this is referred to as <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">strict liability</a><span class="glossdef">Liability without intent.</span></span>. Strict liability torts do not require fault because they do not include an intent component. Strict liability and other intent issues are discussed in detail in <a class="xref" href="storm_1.0-ch04#storm_1.0-ch04">Chapter 4 "The Elements of a Crime"</a>. Another situation where the defendant may be liable without fault is if the defendant did not actually commit any act but is associated with the acting defendant through a <em class="emphasis">special relationship</em>. The policy of holding a separate entity or individual liable for the defendant’s action is called <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">vicarious liability</a><span class="glossdef">The transfer of a defendant’s liability based upon a special relationship.</span></span>. An example of vicarious liability is employer-employee liability, also referred to as <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">respondeat superior</a><span class="glossdef">A doctrine that holds the employer civilly liable for an employee’s conduct while on the job.</span></span>. If an employee injures a plaintiff while on the job, the <em class="emphasis">employer</em> may be liable for the plaintiff’s injuries, whether or not the employer is at fault. Clearly, between the employer and the employee, the employer generally has the better ability to pay.</p>

Chris attempts to multitask and pour hot coffee while simultaneously handing out change. He loses his grip on the coffee pot and spills steaming-hot coffee on his customer Geoff’s hand. In this case, Geoff can sue <em class="emphasis">McDonald’s and Chris</em> if he sustains injuries. McDonald’s is not technically at fault, but it may be liable for Geoff’s injuries under a theory of respondeat superior.</p>

        <div class="section" id="storm_1.0-ch01_s03_s01_s04">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Harm Requirement</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="storm_1.0-ch01_s03_s01_s04_p01">The goal of civil litigation is to compensate the plaintiff for injuries, so the plaintiff must be a bona fide <strong class="emphasis bold">victim</strong> that can prove <strong class="emphasis bold">harm</strong>. If there is no evidence of harm, the plaintiff has no basis for the civil litigation matter. An example would be when a defendant rear-ends a plaintiff in an automobile accident without causing damage to the vehicle (property damage) or physical injury. Even if the defendant is at fault for the automobile accident, the plaintiff cannot sue because the plaintiff does not need compensation for any injuries or losses.</p>

        <div class="section" id="storm_1.0-ch01_s03_s01_s05">

            <p class="para editable block" id="storm_1.0-ch01_s03_s01_s05_p01">Often the plaintiff sues the defendant for money rather than a different, performance-oriented remedy. In a civil litigation matter, any money the court awards to the plaintiff is called <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">damages</a><span class="glossdef">Money the court awards the plaintiff in a civil litigation matter.</span></span>. Several kinds of damages may be appropriate. The plaintiff can sue for <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">compensatory damages</a><span class="glossdef">Damages that compensate the plaintiff for injury.</span></span>, which compensate for injuries, <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">costs</a><span class="glossdef">Damages that reimburse the plaintiff for money spent on the civil lawsuit.</span></span>, which repay the lawsuit expenses, and in some cases, <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">punitive damages</a><span class="glossdef">Damages designed to punish the defendant.</span></span>. Punitive damages, also referred to as <strong class="emphasis bold">exemplary damages</strong>, are <em class="emphasis">not</em> designed to compensate the plaintiff but instead focus on <em class="emphasis">punishing</em> the defendant for causing the injury.<span class="footnote" id="storm_1.0-fn01_003"><em class="emphasis">BMW of North America, Inc. v.

            <p class="para editable block" id="storm_1.0-ch01_s03_s02_s01_p01">The government institutes the criminal prosecution, rather than an individual plaintiff.

            <p class="para editable block" id="storm_1.0-ch01_s03_s02_s02_p01">The defendant in a criminal prosecution can be represented by a private attorney or a <em class="emphasis">free</em> attorney paid for by the state or federal government if he or she is <em class="emphasis">unable to afford attorney’s fees</em> and <em class="emphasis">facing incarceration</em>.<span class="footnote" id="storm_1.0-fn01_006"><em class="emphasis">Alabama v.

            <p class="para editable block" id="storm_1.0-ch01_s03_s02_s02_p02">The presence of the Constitution at every phase of a criminal prosecution changes the proceedings significantly from the civil lawsuit.

            <p class="para editable block" id="storm_1.0-ch01_s03_s02_s03_p01">Another substantial difference between civil litigation and criminal prosecution is the <em class="emphasis">goal</em>. Recall that the goal of civil litigation is to compensate the plaintiff for injuries. In contrast, the goal of a criminal prosecution is to <em class="emphasis">punish</em> the defendant.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="storm_1.0-ch01_s03_s02_s03_p02">One consequence of the goal of punishment in a criminal prosecution is that <em class="emphasis">fault</em> is almost always an element in any criminal proceeding. This is unlike civil litigation, where the ability to pay is a priority consideration. Clearly, it is unfair to punish a defendant who did nothing wrong. This makes criminal law justice oriented and very satisfying for most students.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="storm_1.0-ch01_s03_s02_s03_p03">Injury and a victim are <em class="emphasis">not</em> necessary components of a criminal prosecution because punishment is the objective, and there is no plaintiff. Thus behavior can be criminal even if it is essentially harmless. Society does not condone or pardon conduct simply because it fails to produce a tangible loss.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="storm_1.0-ch01_s03_s02_s04_p01">Steven is angry because his friend Bob broke his skateboard. Steven gets his gun, which has a silencer on it, and puts it in the glove compartment of his car. He then begins driving to Bob’s house. While Steven is driving, he exceeds the speed limit on three different occasions. Steven arrives at Bob’s house and then he hides in the bushes by the mailbox and waits. After an hour, Bob opens the front door and walks to the mailbox. Bob gets his mail, turns around, and begins walking back to the house. Steven shoots at Bob three different times but misses, and the bullets end up landing in the dirt. Bob does not notice the shots because of the silencer.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="storm_1.0-ch01_s03_s02_s04_p02">In this example, Steven has committed several crimes: (1) If Steven does not have a special permit to carry a concealed weapon, putting the gun in his glove compartment is probably a crime in most states. (2) If Steven does not have a special permit to own a silencer for his gun, this is probably a crime in most states. (3) If Steven does not put the gun in a locked container when he transports it, this is probably a crime in most states. (4) Steven committed a crime each time he exceeded the speed limit. (5) Each time Steven shot at Bob and missed, he probably committed the crime of attempted murder or assault with a deadly weapon in most states. Notice that none of the crimes Steven committed caused any discernible harm. However, common sense dictates that Steven should be punished so he does not commit a criminal act in the future that <em class="emphasis">may</em> result in harm.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="storm_1.0-ch01_s04_p01">Crimes can be classified in many ways. Crimes also can be grouped by subject matter. For example, a crime like assault, battery, or rape tends to injure another person’s body, so it can be classified as a “crime against the person.” If a crime tends to injure a person by depriving him or her of property or by damaging property, it can be classified as a “crime against property.” These classifications are basically for convenience and are not imperative to the study of criminal law.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="storm_1.0-ch01_s04_p02">More important and substantive is the classification of crimes according to the severity of punishment.

The difference between jail and prison is that cities and counties operate jails, and the state or federal government operates prisons, depending on the crime.

        <p class="para editable block" id="storm_1.0-ch01_s06_s01_p01">The first source of law is <strong class="emphasis bold">constitutional law</strong>. Two constitutions are applicable in every state: the federal or US Constitution, which is in force throughout the United States of America, and the state’s constitution. The US Constitution created our legal system, as is discussed in <a class="xref" href="storm_1.0-ch02#storm_1.0-ch02">Chapter 2 "The Legal System in the United States"</a>. States’ constitutions typically focus on issues of local concern.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="storm_1.0-ch01_s06_s01_p02">The purpose of federal and state constitutions is to <em class="emphasis">regulate government action</em>. Private individuals are protected by the Constitution, but they do not have to follow it themselves.</p>

On the other hand, if Cora walks into a Macy’s department store and criticizes the owner of Macy’s, Macy’s could eject Cora immediately. Macy’s and its personnel are <em class="emphasis">private</em>, not government, and they <em class="emphasis">do not</em> have to abide by the Constitution.</p>

Thus there are many <em class="emphasis">exceptions</em> to any constitution’s protections. Constitutional protections and exceptions are discussed in detail in <a class="xref" href="storm_1.0-ch03#storm_1.0-ch03">Chapter 3 "Constitutional Protections"</a>.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="storm_1.0-ch01_s06_s01_s02_p02">For safety and security reasons, we see more exceptions to constitutional protections in <em class="emphasis">public schools</em> and <em class="emphasis">prisons</em>. For example, public schools and prisons can mandate a certain style of dress for the purpose of ensuring safety. Technically, forcing an individual to dress a specific way could violate the right to self-expression, which the First Amendment guarantees. However, if wearing a uniform can lower gang-related conflicts in school and prevent prisoners from successfully escaping, the government can constitutionally suppress free speech in these locations.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="storm_1.0-ch01_s06_s02_p01">The second source of law is <strong class="emphasis bold">statutory law</strong>. While the Constitution applies to government action, statutes apply to and regulate <em class="emphasis">individual</em> or <em class="emphasis">private</em> action. A <strong class="emphasis bold">statute</strong> is a written (and published) law that can be enacted in one of two ways. Most statutes are written and voted into law by the <em class="emphasis">legislative</em> branch of government. This is simply a group of individuals elected for this purpose. The US legislative branch is called <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Congress</a><span class="glossdef">The federal legislative branch of government, responsible for enacting federal statutes.</span></span>, and Congress votes federal statutes into law.

            <p class="para editable block" id="storm_1.0-ch01_s06_s03_s01_p01">In Old England, before the settlement of the United States, case law was the most prevalent source of law. This was in contrast to countries that followed the Roman Law system, which primarily relied on written codes of conduct enacted by legislature. Case law in England was mired in tradition and local customs. Societal principles of law and equity were the guidelines when courts issued their rulings. In an effort to be consistent, English judges made it a policy to follow previous judicial decisions, thereby creating a uniform system of laws throughout the country for the first time. Case law was named <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">common law</a><span class="glossdef">Case law of England that migrated to the United States.</span></span> because it was common to the entire nation.<span class="footnote" id="storm_1.0-fn01_013">Lloyd Duhaime, “Common Law Definition,” Duhaime.org website, accessed September 26, 2010, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.duhaime.org/LegalDictionary/C/CommonLaw.aspx">http://www.duhaime.org/LegalDictionary/C/CommonLaw.aspx</a>.</span></p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="storm_1.0-ch01_s06_s03_s01_p02">The English system of jurisprudence made its way to the United States with the original colonists. Initially, the thirteen colonies unanimously adopted common law as the law of the land. All crimes were common-law crimes, and cases determined criminal elements, defenses, and punishment schemes. Gradually, after the Revolutionary War, hostility toward England and modern reform led to the erosion of common-law crimes and a movement toward codification. States began replacing common-law crimes with statutes enacted by state legislatures. Oxford professor Sir William Blackstone’s <em class="emphasis">Commentaries on the Law of England,</em> which interpreted and summarized English common law, became an essential reference as the nation began the process of converting common-law principles into written statutes, ordinances, and penal codes.<span class="footnote" id="storm_1.0-fn01_014">Lloyd Duhaime, “Common Law Definition,” Duhaime.org website, accessed September 26, 2010, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.duhaime.org/LegalDictionary/C/CommonLaw.aspx">http://www.duhaime.org/LegalDictionary/C/CommonLaw.aspx</a>.</span></p>

This violates notions of fairness. Making up a new crime and punishing the defendant for it does not provide consistency or predictability to our legal system.

Classification of crimes as felonies and misdemeanors is a reflection of English common law. Legislatures often create statutes out of former common-law crimes. Judges look to the common law when defining statutory terms, establishing criminal procedure, and creating defenses to crimes. The United States is considered a common-law country.

        <h3 class="title">Summary</h3>
        <p class="para" id="storm_1.0-ch01_s07_p01">A crime is action or inaction in violation of a criminal law. Criminal laws vary from state to state and from state to federal.</p>
        <p class="para" id="storm_1.0-ch01_s07_p02">The study of criminal law defines crimes and defenses to crimes. The study of criminal procedure focuses on the enforcement of rights by individuals while submitting to government investigation, arrest, interrogation, trial, and appeal.</p>
        <p class="para" id="storm_1.0-ch01_s07_p03">A civil lawsuit or civil litigation matter resolves a dispute between individuals, called a plaintiff (the injured party) and defendant (the alleged wrongdoer). Every civil litigation matter includes a victim (the plaintiff), which has suffered harm. The goal of the civil litigation matter is to compensate the plaintiff for injury. The court can compensate the plaintiff by awarding money, which is called damages. Both parties in a civil litigation matter must represent themselves or hire private attorneys.</p>
        <p class="para" id="storm_1.0-ch01_s07_p04">A criminal prosecution takes place when the government, represented by a prosecutor, takes legal action against the defendant (the alleged wrongdoer) for committing a crime. Some criminal prosecutions do not include a victim, or harm, because the goal of the criminal prosecution is punishment, not compensation. Every criminal prosecution involves the government, so the US and state constitutions provide the criminal defendant with extra protections not present in a civil lawsuit, such as free counsel when the defendant is indigent and facing incarceration.</p>
        <p class="para" id="storm_1.0-ch01_s07_p05">Crimes can be classified according to the severity of punishment. The most serious crimes with the entire range of sentencing options available are felonies. Misdemeanors are less serious than felonies and have less severe sentencing options. Felony-misdemeanors can be prosecuted and punished as a felony or a misdemeanor, depending on the circumstances. Infractions, also called violations, are the least serious crimes and generally do not involve incarceration. The purposes of punishing a criminal defendant are both specific and general deterrence, incapacitation, rehabilitation, retribution, and restitution.</p>
        <p class="para" id="storm_1.0-ch01_s07_p06">Law comes from three sources: the Constitution, a statute, or a case. The Constitution is the highest source of law but is only applicable when there is government action. Statutory law applies to individuals but is inferior to constitutional law. Case law is law made by judges when they rule on the facts of a case. Although case law is technically inferior to statutory law, judges must interpret statutes and the Constitution, so case law can be the most powerful source of law. When a case invalidates a statute as unconstitutional, this action is called judicial review. Case law stays consistent because judges follow previous court decisions, called precedent. This policy, called stare decisis, lends predictability to case law but is not absolute, and courts can deviate from it to update the law.</p>

            <li>The reason criminal defendants get special protections not extended to civil litigation defendants is the harshness of the <em class="emphasis">punishment</em> and the <em class="emphasis">inequality</em> of the criminal prosecution itself. Criminal defendants may lose their life or their liberty. Civil litigation defendants risk only a loss of <em class="emphasis">money</em>. In addition, criminal defendants face the intimidating prospect of fighting the government and all its vast resources. Civil litigation defendants are squaring off against <em class="emphasis">another individual</em>. As a society, we believe that there is nothing as unjust as punishing an innocent person. Thus we give criminal defendants special protections to level the playing field.</li>
