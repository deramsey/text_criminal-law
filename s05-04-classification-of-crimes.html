    <p class="para editable block" id="storm_1.0-ch01_s04_p01">Crimes can be classified in many ways. Crimes also can be grouped by subject matter. For example, a crime like assault, battery, or rape tends to injure another person’s body, so it can be classified as a “crime against the person.” If a crime tends to injure a person by depriving him or her of property or by damaging property, it can be classified as a “crime against property.” These classifications are basically for convenience and are not imperative to the study of criminal law.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="storm_1.0-ch01_s04_p02">More important and substantive is the classification of crimes according to the severity of punishment. This is called <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">grading</a><span class="glossdef">Classification of crimes by the severity of punishment.</span></span>. Crimes are generally graded into four categories: <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">felonies</a><span class="glossdef">The most serious crimes, which are graded the highest.</span></span>, <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">misdemeanors</a><span class="glossdef">Crimes that are graded lower than felonies but higher than infractions.</span></span>, <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">felony-misdemeanors</a><span class="glossdef">Crimes that can be prosecuted as a felony or a misdemeanor, depending on the circumstances.</span></span>, and <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">infractions</a><span class="glossdef">The least serious crimes, which are graded the lowest. Also called violations.</span></span>. Often the criminal intent element affects a crime’s grading. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Malum in se</a><span class="glossdef">Crimes that are evil in nature.</span></span> crimes, murder, for example, are evil in their nature and are generally graded higher than <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">malum prohibitum</a><span class="glossdef">Crimes that are regulatory in nature.</span></span> crimes, which are regulatory, like a failure to pay income taxes.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Felonies</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="storm_1.0-ch01_s04_s01_p01"><strong class="emphasis bold">Felonies</strong> are the <em class="emphasis">most serious</em> crimes. They are either supported by a heinous intent, like the intent to kill, or accompanied by an extremely serious result, such as loss of life, grievous injury, or destruction of property. Felonies are serious, so they are graded the highest, and all sentencing options are available. Depending on the jurisdiction and the crime, the sentence could be execution, <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">prison</a><span class="glossdef">Incarceration facility appropriate for felonies and operated by the state or federal government.</span></span> time, a fine, or alternative sentencing such as probation, rehabilitation, and home confinement. Potential consequences of a felony conviction also include the inability to vote, own a weapon, or even participate in certain careers.</p>

    <div class="section" id="storm_1.0-ch01_s04_s02">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Misdemeanors</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="storm_1.0-ch01_s04_s02_p01"><strong class="emphasis bold">Misdemeanors</strong> are <em class="emphasis">less serious</em> than felonies, either because the intent requirement is of a lower level or because the result is less extreme. Misdemeanors are usually punishable by <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">jail</a><span class="glossdef">Incarceration facility appropriate for misdemeanors and operated by a city or county.</span></span> time of one year or less per misdemeanor, a fine, or alternative sentencing like probation, rehabilitation, or community service. Note that incarceration for a misdemeanor is in jail rather than prison. The difference between jail and prison is that cities and counties operate jails, and the state or federal government operates prisons, depending on the crime. The restrictive nature of the confinement also differs between jail and prison. Jails are for defendants who have committed less serious offenses, so they are generally less restrictive than prisons.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="storm_1.0-ch01_s04_s03_p01"><strong class="emphasis bold">Felony-misdemeanors</strong> are crimes that the government can prosecute and punish as <em class="emphasis">either</em> a felony or a misdemeanor, depending on the particular circumstances accompanying the offense. The discretion whether to prosecute the crime as a felony or misdemeanor usually belongs to the <em class="emphasis">judge</em>, but in some instances the <em class="emphasis">prosecutor</em> can make the decision.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Infractions</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="storm_1.0-ch01_s04_s04_p01"><strong class="emphasis bold">Infractions</strong>, which can also be called <strong class="emphasis bold">violations</strong>, are the least serious crimes and include minor offenses such as jaywalking and motor vehicle offenses that result in a simple traffic ticket. Infractions are generally punishable by a fine or alternative sentencing such as traffic school.</p>
