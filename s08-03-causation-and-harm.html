Many incidents occur when the defendant technically initiates circumstances that result in harm, but it would be unjust to hold the defendant criminally responsible. Thus causation should not be rigidly determined in every instance, and the trier of fact must perform an analysis that promotes fairness. In this section, causation in fact and legal causation are examined as well as situations where the defendant may be insulated from criminal responsibility.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="storm_1.0-ch04_s03_s01_p01">Every causation analysis is twofold. First, the defendant must be the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">factual or but for cause</a><span class="glossdef">The defendant starts the chain of events leading to the harm.</span></span> of the victim’s harm. The <em class="emphasis">but for</em> term comes from this phrase: “but for the defendant’s act, the harm would not have occurred.”<span class="footnote" id="storm_1.0-fn04_026">Del. Code Ann. tit. II, § 261, accessed February 14, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://delcode.delaware.gov/title11/c002/index.shtml#261">http://delcode.delaware.gov/title11/c002/index.shtml#261</a>.</span> As the Model Penal Code states, “[c]onduct is the cause of a result when…(a) it is an antecedent but for which the result in question would not have occurred” (Model Penal Code § 2.03(1)(a)). Basically, the defendant is the factual or but for cause of the victim’s harm if the defendant’s act starts the chain of events that leads to the eventual result.</p>

            <h2 class="title editable block">Example of Factual Cause</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="storm_1.0-ch04_s03_s01_s01_p01">Henry and Mary get into an argument over their child custody agreement. Henry gives Mary a hard shove. Mary staggers backward, is struck by lightning, and dies instantly. In this example, Henry’s act forced Mary to move into the area where the lighting happened to strike. However, it would be <em class="emphasis">unjust</em> to punish Henry for Mary’s death in this case because Henry could not have imagined the eventual result. Thus although Henry is the <strong class="emphasis bold">factual or but for cause</strong> of Mary’s death, he is probably not the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">legal cause</a><span class="glossdef">The defendant is criminally responsible for the harm because it is a foreseeable consequence of the defendant’s criminal act.</span></span>.</p>

    <div class="section" id="storm_1.0-ch04_s03_s02">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Legal Causation</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="storm_1.0-ch04_s03_s02_p01">It is the second part of the analysis that ensures fairness in the application of the causation element. The defendant must also be the <strong class="emphasis bold">legal</strong> or <strong class="emphasis bold">proximate cause</strong> of the harm. Proximate means “near,” so the defendant’s conduct must be closely related to the harm it engenders. As the Model Penal Code states, the actual result cannot be “too remote or accidental in its occurrence to have a [just] bearing on the actor’s liability” (Model Penal Code § 2.03 (2) (b)).</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="storm_1.0-ch04_s03_s02_p02">The test for legal causation is objective foreseeability.<span class="footnote" id="storm_1.0-fn04_027">California Criminal Jury Instructions No. 520, accessed February 14, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.justia.com/criminal/docs/calcrim/500/520.html">http://www.justia.com/criminal/docs/calcrim/500/520.html</a>.</span> The trier of fact must be convinced that when the defendant acted, a <em class="emphasis">reasonable person</em> could have <em class="emphasis">foreseen</em> or predicted that the end result would occur. In the example given in <a class="xref" href="#storm_1.0-ch04_s03_s01_s01">Section 4 "Example of Factual Cause"</a>, Henry is not the legal cause of Mary’s death because a reasonable person could have neither foreseen nor predicted that a shove would push Mary into a spot where lightning was about to strike.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="storm_1.0-ch04_s03_s02_p03">The Model Penal Code adjusts the legal causation foreseeability requirement depending on whether the defendant acted purposely, knowingly, recklessly, or negligently. If the defendant’s behavior is reckless or negligent, the legal causation foreseeability requirement is analyzed based on the <em class="emphasis">risk</em> of harm, rather than the <em class="emphasis">purpose</em> of the defendant.</p>

            <h2 class="title editable block">Example of Legal Causation</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="storm_1.0-ch04_s03_s02_s01_p01">Imagine that Henry and Mary get into the same argument over their child custody agreement, but this time they are in their garage, which is crowded with furniture. Henry gives Mary a hard shove, even though she is standing directly in front of a large entertainment center filled with books and a heavy thirty-two-inch television set. Mary staggers backward into the entertainment center and it crashes down on top of her, killing her. In this situation, Henry is the factual cause of Mary’s death because he started the chain of events that led to her death with his push. In addition, it is <em class="emphasis">foreseeable</em> that Mary might suffer a serious injury or death when shoved directly into a large and heavy piece of furniture. Thus in this example, Henry could be the factual <em class="emphasis">and</em> legal cause of Mary’s death. It is up to the trier of fact to make this determination based on an assessment of objective foreseeability and the attendant circumstances.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="storm_1.0-ch04_s03_s03_p01">Another situation where the defendant is the factual but not the legal cause of the requisite harm is when something or someone interrupts the chain of events started by the defendant.

            <p class="para editable block" id="storm_1.0-ch04_s03_s03_s01_p01">Review the example with Henry and Mary in <a class="xref" href="#storm_1.0-ch04_s03_s02_s01">Section 4 "Example of Legal Causation"</a>. Change the example so that Henry pulls out a knife and chases Mary out of the garage. Mary escapes Henry and hides in an abandoned shed. Half an hour later, Wes, a homeless man living in the shed, returns from a day of panhandling. When he discovers Mary in the shed, he kills her and steals her money and jewelry. In this case, Henry is still the <strong class="emphasis bold">factual cause</strong> of Mary’s death, because he chased her into the shed where she was eventually killed. However, Wes is probably the <strong class="emphasis bold">intervening superseding cause</strong> of Mary’s death because he interrupted the chain of events started by Henry. Thus <em class="emphasis">Wes</em> is subject to prosecution for Mary’s death, and Henry may be prosecuted only for assault with a deadly weapon.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="storm_1.0-ch04_s03_s04_p01">In criminal homicide cases, the causation analysis could be complicated by a victim’s <em class="emphasis">survival</em> for an extended time period. Because of modern technology, victims often stay alive on machines for many years after they have been harmed. However, it may be unreasonable to hold a defendant responsible for a death that occurs several years after the defendant’s criminal act. A few states have rules that solve this dilemma.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="storm_1.0-ch04_s03_s04_p02">Some states have either a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">one year and a day rule</a><span class="glossdef">The victim must die within one year and a day of the defendant’s criminal act, or the defendant will not be the legal cause of death.</span></span> or a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">three years and a day rule</a><span class="glossdef">The victim must die within three years and a day of the defendant’s criminal act, or the defendant will not be the legal cause of death.</span></span>.<span class="footnote" id="storm_1.0-fn04_029">S.C.

Under one or three years and a day rules, the victim of a criminal homicide must die within the specified time limits for the defendant to be criminally responsible. If the victim does not die within the time limits, the defendant may be charged with <em class="emphasis">attempted murder</em>, rather than criminal homicide.

                <li>Phillipa sees Fred picking up trash along the highway and decides she wants to frighten him. She drives a quarter of a mile ahead of Fred and parks her car. She then hides in the bushes and waits for Fred to show up. When Fred gets close enough, she jumps out of the bushes screaming. Frightened, Fred drops his trash bag and runs into the middle of the highway where he is struck by a vehicle and killed.

                <li>Read <em class="emphasis">Bullock v. State</em>, 775 A.2d. 1043 (2001). In <em class="emphasis">Bullock</em>, the defendant was convicted of manslaughter based on a vehicle collision that occurred when his vehicle hit the victim’s vehicle in an intersection. The defendant was under the influence of alcohol and traveling thirty miles per hour over the speed limit. The victim was in the intersection <em class="emphasis">unlawfully</em> because the light was red. The defendant claimed that the victim was the <strong class="emphasis bold">intervening superseding cause</strong> of her own death. Did the Supreme Court of Delaware agree?
