Manslaughter is a killing supported by malice negated by a heat of passion, reckless, or negligent criminal intent.</li>
                <li>Voluntary manslaughter is a killing that occurs during an adequately provoked heat of passion.</li>
                <li>An adequate provocation is one sufficient to goad a reasonable person into killing and that actually provokes the defendant into killing.</li>
                <li>A killing must occur during a heat of passion to be classified as voluntary manslaughter. If a killing occurs before the heat of passion is provoked or after the heat of passion has cooled, it probably will be classified as murder.</li>
                <li>Voluntary manslaughter is supported by murder intent that has been negated in an adequately provoked heat of passion. Involuntary manslaughter lacks murder intent altogether.</li>
                <li>The three types of involuntary manslaughter are misdemeanor manslaughter, reckless or negligent involuntary manslaughter, and vehicular manslaughter.</li>
                <li>Manslaughter is typically graded lower than murder. Voluntary manslaughter is typically graded higher than involuntary manslaughter. The Model Penal Code grades all manslaughters as felonies of the second degree and grades negligent homicide as a felony of the third degree.</li>
