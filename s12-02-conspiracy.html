Shelley mentions that she and her friend Steffy work at a convenience store. Sam asks Shelley if she would like to help him rob the convenience store when Steffy is working. Shelley agrees. The two plan the robbery. Shelley and Sam agree that Shelley will drive the getaway car on the appointed date and time. Shelley informs Sam that Steffy is extremely meek and fearful and will readily hand over cash out of the cash register if Sam uses a fake handgun. Shelley and Sam probably have the criminal intent element required for conspiracy. Shelley and Sam have the intent to <em class="emphasis">agree to work together</em> because they both need each other to successfully complete the convenience store robbery. In addition, Shelley and Sam have the intent to <em class="emphasis">successfully commit the robbery</em> because they both want the money the robbery will produce. Thus if no overt act is required in their jurisdiction, Shelley and Sam most likely have completed the crime of conspiracy and may be prosecuted for this offense whether or not the robbery actually takes place.</p>

As the Model Penal Code states, “[i]f a person guilty of conspiracy…knows that a person with whom he conspires to commit a crime has conspired with another person or persons to commit the same crime, he is guilty of conspiring with such other person or persons, whether or not he knows their identity” (Model Penal Code § 5.03(2)). Large-scale conspiracies, such as conspiracies to distribute contraband or illegal firearms, may result in each member sharing criminal responsibility for the conspiracy and every separate conspiracy transaction.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="storm_1.0-ch08_s02_s03_p02">A conspiracy that has more than one criminal objective still can be just <em class="emphasis">one</em> conspiracy. Under the Model Penal Code, “[i]f a person conspires to commit a number of crimes, he is guilty of only one conspiracy so long as such multiple crimes are the object of the same agreement or continuous conspiratorial relationship” (Model Penal Code § 5.03(3)).</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="storm_1.0-ch08_s02_s03_p03">It is useful to understand two basic large-scale conspiracy organizational formats: wheel and chain conspiracies. A <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">wheel conspiracy</a><span class="glossdef">A conspiracy where each member is connected to one central coconspirator.</span></span> consists of a single conspirator, generally the ringleader who is interconnected to every other coconspirator. The ringleader is the hub; the other coconspirators are the spokes of the wheel. An example of a wheel conspiracy would be a mob boss linked to individual members of the mob following his or her commands. A <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">chain conspiracy</a><span class="glossdef">A conspiracy where each member is interconnected in a linear fashion.</span></span> consists of coconspirators connected to each other like links in a chain but without a central interconnected ringleader. An example of a chain conspiracy is a conspiracy to manufacture and distribute a controlled substance, with the manufacturer linked to the transporter, who sells to a large-quantity dealer, who thereafter sells to a smaller-quantity dealer, who sells to a customer. Whether the conspiracy is wheel, chain, or otherwise, if the jurisdiction has a statute or common-law rule that each member does not need to personally know every other member as discussed previously, the coconspirators may be criminally responsible for the <strong class="emphasis bold">conspiracy</strong> <em class="emphasis">and</em> the crime(s) it furthers.</p>

Assume that on the night of the convenience store robbery, Lucy, an armed, off-duty police officer, wanders into the store to purchase cigarettes at the moment Sam pulls out his fake handgun. Lucy yanks her concealed handgun out of her waistband and tells Sam to drop the weapon. Jolene, another customer in the store, observes the two pointing guns at each other and suffers a fatal heart attack. In many jurisdictions, both Shelley and Sam probably could be criminally responsible for <strong class="emphasis bold">conspiracy</strong> to commit robbery, <strong class="emphasis bold">attempted</strong> robbery, and the <strong class="emphasis bold">murder</strong> of Jolene. Shelley and Sam attempted to commit the robbery <em class="emphasis">in furtherance</em> of the conspiracy.

Robbery is a crime of violence, so a death that occurs during a robbery is foreseeable, even though Sam is armed with only a pretend handgun.

The Model Penal Code allows the defense and provides, “It is an affirmative defense that the actor, after conspiring to commit a crime, thwarted the success of the conspiracy, under circumstances manifesting a complete and voluntary renunciation of his criminal purpose” (Model Penal Code § 5.03(6)).</p>

In this example, Shelley and Sam agree to commit a robbery at the convenience store where Steffy is a cashier. Adjust the example so that Shelley has a change of heart and contacts law enforcement about the robbery before she drives Sam to the convenience store in the getaway car. Law enforcement officers ask Shelley to help them apprehend Sam, and she agrees. Shelley drives Sam to the convenience store as planned. Two law enforcement officers dress in plainclothes and pretend to be shopping in the convenience store when Sam arrives. As soon as Sam pulls out his fake handgun, they arrest him. If Shelley is in a jurisdiction that recognizes the <strong class="emphasis bold">renunciation</strong> defense, she probably will have a valid defense to a charge of conspiracy. Although Shelley committed the criminal act for conspiracy with the requisite criminal intent, she <em class="emphasis">voluntarily</em> and <em class="emphasis">completely</em> renounced the conspiracy and <em class="emphasis">thwarted</em> the crime that was its object. Thus Shelly has likely met the requirements of renunciation, and only Sam may be charged with a crime or crimes in this scenario.</p>

                <li>Conspiracy is an inchoate crime because the defendants might never complete the offense that is the conspiracy’s object.</li>
                <li>The criminal act element required for conspiracy is an agreement to commit any crime, commit a felony, falsely indict another for a crime, or falsely maintain any lawsuit, depending on the jurisdiction.</li>
                <li>The overt act required for conspiracy can be preparatory activity; the criminal act element required for attempt must be more than mere preparation.</li>
                <li>The criminal intent element required for conspiracy is specific intent or purposely to agree to commit the offense that is the conspiracy’s object.</li>
                <li>The acquittal of or failure to prosecute one coconspirator does not prohibit the prosecution of other coconspirators in some jurisdictions.</li>
                <li>A coconspirator does not need to know every other coconspirator; as long as a coconspirator is aware that there are other members, he or she can be criminally responsible for conspiracy.</li>
                <li>A wheel conspiracy connects all members to one central member. A chain conspiracy interconnects the members in a linear fashion.</li>
                <li>The Pinkerton rule holds conspiracy members criminally responsible for every foreseeable crime committed in furtherance of the conspiracy.</li>
                <li>Wharton’s rule could create a judicial presumption that a defendant cannot be criminally responsible for conspiracy and the crime that is its object if the conspiracy has only two members, and the crime that is its object requires two defendants.</li>
                <li>Renunciation is an affirmative defense to conspiracy in some jurisdictions if the defendant voluntarily and completely renounces the conspiracy and thwarts the crime that is its object.</li>
                <li>Generally, conspiracy does not merge like attempt; a defendant can be convicted of conspiracy and the crime conspired.</li>
                <li>Some jurisdictions grade conspiracy the same as the conspired offense; other jurisdictions grade conspiracy lower than the conspired offense. It is not unconstitutional to grade conspiracy higher than the offense that is its object.</li>
                <li>Federal RICO is a statute that is designed to punish organized crime.</li>
