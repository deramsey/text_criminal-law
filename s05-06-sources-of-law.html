        <p class="para editable block" id="storm_1.0-ch01_s06_s01_p01">The first source of law is <strong class="emphasis bold">constitutional law</strong>. Two constitutions are applicable in every state: the federal or US Constitution, which is in force throughout the United States of America, and the state’s constitution. The US Constitution created our legal system, as is discussed in <a class="xref" href="storm_1.0-ch02#storm_1.0-ch02">Chapter 2 "The Legal System in the United States"</a>. States’ constitutions typically focus on issues of local concern.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="storm_1.0-ch01_s06_s01_p02">The purpose of federal and state constitutions is to <em class="emphasis">regulate government action</em>. Private individuals are protected by the Constitution, but they do not have to follow it themselves.</p>

Although other individuals may be annoyed by Cora’s words, the government <em class="emphasis">cannot</em> arrest or criminally prosecute Cora for her speech because the First Amendment of the US Constitution guarantees each individual the right to speak freely. On the other hand, if Cora walks into a Macy’s department store and criticizes the owner of Macy’s, Macy’s could eject Cora immediately. Macy’s and its personnel are <em class="emphasis">private</em>, not government, and they <em class="emphasis">do not</em> have to abide by the Constitution.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="storm_1.0-ch01_s06_s01_s02_p01">The federal and state constitutions are both written with words that can be subject to more than one interpretation. Thus there are many <em class="emphasis">exceptions</em> to any constitution’s protections. Constitutional protections and exceptions are discussed in detail in <a class="xref" href="storm_1.0-ch03#storm_1.0-ch03">Chapter 3 "Constitutional Protections"</a>.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="storm_1.0-ch01_s06_s01_s02_p02">For safety and security reasons, we see more exceptions to constitutional protections in <em class="emphasis">public schools</em> and <em class="emphasis">prisons</em>. For example, public schools and prisons can mandate a certain style of dress for the purpose of ensuring safety. Technically, forcing an individual to dress a specific way could violate the right to self-expression, which the First Amendment guarantees. However, if wearing a uniform can lower gang-related conflicts in school and prevent prisoners from successfully escaping, the government can constitutionally suppress free speech in these locations.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="storm_1.0-ch01_s06_s01_s03_p01">Of the three sources of law, constitutional law is considered the <em class="emphasis">highest</em> and should not be supplanted by either of the other two sources of law. Pursuant to principles of federal supremacy, the <em class="emphasis">federal</em> or US Constitution is the most preeminent source of law, and state constitutions cannot supersede it.

        <h2 class="title editable block">Statutory Law</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="storm_1.0-ch01_s06_s02_p01">The second source of law is <strong class="emphasis bold">statutory law</strong>. While the Constitution applies to government action, statutes apply to and regulate <em class="emphasis">individual</em> or <em class="emphasis">private</em> action. A <strong class="emphasis bold">statute</strong> is a written (and published) law that can be enacted in one of two ways. Most statutes are written and voted into law by the <em class="emphasis">legislative</em> branch of government. This is simply a group of individuals elected for this purpose. The US legislative branch is called <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Congress</a><span class="glossdef">The federal legislative branch of government, responsible for enacting federal statutes.</span></span>, and Congress votes federal statutes into law. Every state has a legislative branch as well, called a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">state legislature</a><span class="glossdef">The state legislative branch of government, responsible for enacting state statutes.</span></span>, and a state legislature votes state statutes into law. Often, states codify their <em class="emphasis">criminal</em> statutes into a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">penal code</a><span class="glossdef">State criminal statutes.</span></span>.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="storm_1.0-ch01_s06_s02_p02">State citizens can also vote state statutes into law. Although a state legislature adopts <em class="emphasis">most</em> state statutes, citizens voting on a ballot can enact some very important statutes. For example, a majority of California’s citizens voted to enact California’s medicinal marijuana law.<span class="footnote" id="storm_1.0-fn01_011">California Compassionate Use Act of 1996, Cal.

Administrative agencies can be federal or state and contain not only a legislative branch but also an executive (enforcement) branch and judicial (court) branch. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is an example of a federal administrative agency. The FDA regulates any food products or drugs produced and marketed in the United States.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="storm_1.0-ch01_s06_s02_s02_p03">Ordinances are similar to statutes, except that <em class="emphasis">cities</em> and <em class="emphasis">counties</em> vote them into law, rather than a state’s legislature or a state’s citizens. Ordinances usually relate to health, safety, or welfare, and violations of them are typically classified as <strong class="emphasis bold">infractions</strong> or <strong class="emphasis bold">misdemeanors</strong>, rather than <strong class="emphasis bold">felonies</strong>. A written law prohibiting jaywalking within a city’s or county’s limits is an example of an ordinance.</p>

The intent of the Model Penal Code was to provide a standardized set of criminal statutes that all states could adopt, thus simplifying the diversity effect of the United States’ legal system. While the Model Penal Code has not been universally adopted, a majority of the states have incorporated portions of it into their penal codes, and the Model Penal Code survives as a guideline and focal point for discussion when state legislatures modify their criminal statutes.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="storm_1.0-ch01_s06_s03_s01_p01">In Old England, before the settlement of the United States, case law was the most prevalent source of law. This was in contrast to countries that followed the Roman Law system, which primarily relied on written codes of conduct enacted by legislature. Case law in England was mired in tradition and local customs. Societal principles of law and equity were the guidelines when courts issued their rulings. In an effort to be consistent, English judges made it a policy to follow previous judicial decisions, thereby creating a uniform system of laws throughout the country for the first time. Case law was named <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">common law</a><span class="glossdef">Case law of England that migrated to the United States.</span></span> because it was common to the entire nation.<span class="footnote" id="storm_1.0-fn01_013">Lloyd Duhaime, “Common Law Definition,” Duhaime.org website, accessed September 26, 2010, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.duhaime.org/LegalDictionary/C/CommonLaw.aspx">http://www.duhaime.org/LegalDictionary/C/CommonLaw.aspx</a>.</span></p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="storm_1.0-ch01_s06_s03_s01_p02">The English system of jurisprudence made its way to the United States with the original colonists. Initially, the thirteen colonies unanimously adopted common law as the law of the land. All crimes were common-law crimes, and cases determined criminal elements, defenses, and punishment schemes. Gradually, after the Revolutionary War, hostility toward England and modern reform led to the erosion of common-law crimes and a movement toward codification. States began replacing common-law crimes with statutes enacted by state legislatures. Oxford professor Sir William Blackstone’s <em class="emphasis">Commentaries on the Law of England,</em> which interpreted and summarized English common law, became an essential reference as the nation began the process of converting common-law principles into written statutes, ordinances, and penal codes.<span class="footnote" id="storm_1.0-fn01_014">Lloyd Duhaime, “Common Law Definition,” Duhaime.org website, accessed September 26, 2010, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.duhaime.org/LegalDictionary/C/CommonLaw.aspx">http://www.duhaime.org/LegalDictionary/C/CommonLaw.aspx</a>.</span></p>

This violates notions of fairness. Making up a new crime and punishing the defendant for it does not provide consistency or predictability to our legal system. It also violates the principle of legality, a core concept of American criminal justice embodied in this phrase: “Nullum crimen sine lege, nulla poena sine crimen” (No crime without law, no punishment without crime).</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="storm_1.0-ch01_s06_s03_s02_p02">In states that do not allow common-law crimes, <strong class="emphasis bold">statutes</strong> must define criminal conduct.

Classification of crimes as felonies and misdemeanors is a reflection of English common law. Legislatures often create statutes out of former common-law crimes. Judges look to the common law when defining statutory terms, establishing criminal procedure, and creating defenses to crimes. The United States is considered a common-law country.

Brandon, the prosecuting attorney, finds case precedent from the <em class="emphasis">New Mexico Supreme Court</em>, dated <em class="emphasis">2008</em>, indicating that a first-degree murder prosecution is appropriate. The trial court will probably follow the precedent submitted by Brandon because it is newer, from a higher court, and from the same court system as the trial.</p>

They can also contain more than one case law, depending on the number of issues addressed. Case briefs reduce a judicial opinion to its essentials and can be instrumental in understanding the most important aspects of the case. Standard case brief formats can differ, but one format that attorneys and paralegals commonly use is explained in the following paragraph.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="storm_1.0-ch01_s06_s03_s04_s04_p03">Review the <em class="emphasis">Keeler</em> case brief. The case brief should begin with the <strong class="emphasis bold">title of the case</strong>, including the <strong class="emphasis bold">citation</strong>. The next component of the case brief should be the <strong class="emphasis bold">procedural facts</strong>. The procedural facts should include two pieces of information: <em class="emphasis">who is appealing</em> and <em class="emphasis">which court</em> the case is in. As you can see from the <em class="emphasis">Keeler</em> case brief, Keeler brought an application for a writ of prohibition, and the court is the California Supreme Court. Following the procedural facts are the <strong class="emphasis bold">substantive facts</strong>, which should be a short description of the facts that instigated the court trial and appeal. The procedural and substantive facts are followed by the <strong class="emphasis bold">issue</strong>. The issue is the question the court is examining, which is usually the grounds for appeal. The case brief should phrase the issue as a question. Cases usually have more than one issue. The case brief can state all the issues or only the issue that is most important. The <strong class="emphasis bold">substantive holding</strong> comes after the issue, is <em class="emphasis">actually the case law</em>, and answers the issue question. If more than one issue is presented in the case brief, a substantive holding should address each issue.</p>

This book discusses court procedure in detail in <a class="xref" href="storm_1.0-ch02#storm_1.0-ch02">Chapter 2 "The Legal System in the United States"</a>.

If a judge agrees with the judicial opinion, the judge could write a <strong class="emphasis bold">concurring opinion</strong>, which explains why the judge agrees. If a judge disagrees with the judicial opinion, the judge could write a <strong class="emphasis bold">dissenting opinion</strong> explaining why the judge disagrees. The dissenting opinion will not change the judicial opinion, but it may also be used as precedent in a future case if there are grounds for changing the law.</p>
