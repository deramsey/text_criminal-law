        <h2 class="title editable block">Infancy</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="storm_1.0-ch06_s02_s01_p01">Many states recognize the defense of <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">infancy</a><span class="glossdef">A defense that asserts the defendant is too young to form the requisite intent for the crime.</span></span>. <strong class="emphasis bold">Infancy</strong> asserts that the defendant is not subject to criminal prosecution because he or she is <em class="emphasis">too young</em> to commit a crime. The policy supporting the infancy defense is the belief that juvenile defendants are too immature to form criminal intent. The infancy defense is typically statutory and can be perfect or imperfect, depending on the jurisdiction.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="storm_1.0-ch06_s02_s01_p02">States divide up the jurisdiction of criminal defendants between juvenile courts and adult courts. Juvenile court systems generally retain jurisdiction over criminal defendants under the age of sixteen, seventeen, or eighteen, with exceptions. The Model Penal Code position is that “[a] person shall not be tried for or convicted of an offense if: (a) at the time of the conduct charged to constitute the offense he was less than sixteen years of age, [in which case the Juvenile Court shall have exclusive jurisdiction]” (Model Penal Code § 4.10(1)(a)).</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="storm_1.0-ch06_s02_s01_p03">The primary purpose of a juvenile court adjudication is <strong class="emphasis bold">rehabilitation</strong>. The goal is to reform the minor before he or she becomes an adult. In most states, the infancy defense protects a youthful defendant from criminal prosecution as an <em class="emphasis">adult</em>; it does not prohibit a juvenile adjudication. Most minor defendants are adjudicated in juvenile court, so the infancy defense is rarely used.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="storm_1.0-ch06_s02_s01_p04">Juveniles <em class="emphasis">can</em> be prosecuted as adults under certain specified circumstances. At early common law, criminal defendants were divided into three age groups. Those under the age of seven were deemed incapable of forming criminal intent, and could not be criminally prosecuted. Defendants between the ages of seven and fourteen were provided a <strong class="emphasis bold">rebuttable presumption</strong> that they lacked the mental capacity to form criminal intent. Once a defendant turned fourteen, he or she was subject to an adult criminal prosecution. Modern <em class="emphasis">statutes</em> codify the adult criminal prosecution standard for different age groups. Some states follow the early common law and set up rebuttable and irrebuttable presumptions based on the defendant’s age.<span class="footnote" id="storm_1.0-fn06_035">RCW 9A.04.050, accessed December 6, 2010, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://apps.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=9A.04.050">http://apps.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=9A.04.050</a>.</span> Other states set forth a minimum age, such as fourteen or sixteen, and defendants who have reached that age are prosecuted as adults.<span class="footnote" id="storm_1.0-fn06_036">N.Y.

        <p class="para editable block" id="storm_1.0-ch06_s02_s01_p05">When a juvenile court has jurisdiction, the jurisdiction must be forfeited if the juvenile is to be prosecuted as an adult.

        <p class="para editable block" id="storm_1.0-ch06_s02_s01_p06">States vary as to the waiver procedure.

            <p class="para editable block" id="storm_1.0-ch06_s02_s01_s01_p01">Mario is ten years old. Mario shoplifts some candy from the local market and is arrested. The newly elected district attorney decides to make an example of Mario, and begins an adult criminal prosecution against him for theft. In Mario’s state, the juvenile court has exclusive jurisdiction over individuals under the age of eighteen. Mario can probably claim <strong class="emphasis bold">infancy</strong> as a perfect defense to the theft charge. Mario should be adjudicated in juvenile court, not prosecuted as an adult. Therefore, the juvenile court has jurisdiction in this case and Mario’s criminal prosecution should be dismissed.</p>

In general, intoxication can be based on the defendant’s use of alcohol, legal drugs, or illegal drugs. The Model Penal Code defines intoxication as “a disturbance of mental or physical capacities resulting from the introduction of substances into the body” (Model Penal Code § 2.08(5) (a)). The intoxication defense could be perfect or imperfect, statutory or common law, depending on the jurisdiction.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="storm_1.0-ch06_s02_s02_p02">Intoxication is a state that is achieved either <em class="emphasis">voluntarily</em> or <em class="emphasis">involuntarily</em>.

        <p class="para editable block" id="storm_1.0-ch06_s02_s02_p03"><strong class="emphasis bold">Involuntary intoxication</strong> is more likely to provide a defense than voluntary intoxication. Generally, a defendant can claim involuntary intoxication if he or she ingested the drug or alcohol unknowingly or under force, duress, or fraud.<span class="footnote" id="storm_1.0-fn06_042">California Jury Instructions No. 3427, accessed December 7, 2010, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.justia.com/criminal/docs/calcrim/3400/3427.html">http://www.justia.com/criminal/docs/calcrim/3400/3427.html</a>.</span> Involuntary intoxication could affect the defendant’s ability to form criminal intent, thus negating specific intent, dropping murder a degree, or converting murder to manslaughter. The Model Penal Code equates involuntary intoxication with the substantial capacity test, providing “[i]ntoxication which (a) is not self-induced…is an affirmative defense if by reason of such intoxication the actor at the time of his conduct lacks substantial capacity either to appreciate its criminality [wrongfulness] or to conform his conduct to the requirements of law” (Model Penal Code § 2.08 (4)).</p>

Assume that in Shelby’s state, it is currently illegal to sell products over the Internet without charging sales tax. Jonathan meets with Shelby, and asks her to research whether he needs to charge sales tax when he sells products over the Internet. Shelby agrees to research the matter and get back to Jonathan the next day with an answer. After Jonathan leaves, Shelby is contacted by her friend Margaret, who wants to take an impromptu trip to New York City. Margaret asks Shelby if she would like to come along. Shelby agrees, rushes home, packs for the trip, and leaves with Margaret. The next day while Shelby is watching a Broadway play with Margaret, Jonathan calls Shelby on her cell phone and asks Shelby what her research revealed about the sales tax question. Even though she has <em class="emphasis">not</em> done any research on the matter, Shelby responds, “I just finished the research.

                        <li>Voluntary intoxication may provide a defense if the intoxication prevents the defendant from forming the requisite criminal intent for the offense.</li>
                        <li>Involuntary intoxication is intoxication achieved unknowingly or pursuant to force, duress, or fraud.</li>
                        <li>Voluntary intoxication is frowned on as a defense and in many states does not provide a defense to certain crimes, such as reckless intent crimes. Involuntary intoxication is more likely to serve as a defense any time the defendant is incapable of forming the requisite criminal intent for the offense.</li>
                        <li>Mistake of law may provide a defense if the defendant believes his or her conduct is legal because of reliance on a statute or judicial opinion that is later overturned.</li>
                        <li>Mistake of law is not a defense when the defendant believes his or her conduct is legal because of reliance on the incorrect advice of an attorney.</li>
                        <li>If the facts as the defendant believes them to be prevent the defendant from forming the requisite intent for the crime, mistake of fact could be a valid defense.</li>
                        <li>Mistake of fact is not a defense to strict liability crimes because intent is not an element.</li>

                        <li>Burt, a sixteen-year-old, consumes alcohol for the first time at a party. Unaware of alcohol’s effect, Burt drinks too much, attempts to walk home, and is cited for being drunk in public. In Burt’s state, the juvenile court has concurrent jurisdiction over minors ages seventeen and under, with a waiver to adult court available at the judge’s discretion. Burt has not broken any laws before. Is it likely that the judge will <strong class="emphasis bold">waive</strong> juvenile court jurisdiction in this case and allow the adult criminal prosecution of Burt? Why or why not?</li>
                        <li>Read <em class="emphasis">People v. Register</em>, 60 N.Y.2d 270 (1983). In <em class="emphasis">Register</em>, the defendant shot and killed an individual in a bar after drinking heavily for many hours. The defendant thereafter sought a jury instruction on the <strong class="emphasis bold">intoxication</strong> defense to a charge of depraved mind murder. The trial court refused, and the defendant was convicted. Did the Court of Appeals of the State of New York uphold the conviction? The case is available at this link: <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=9019321014077082981&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2&amp;as_vis=1&amp;oi=">http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=9019321014077082981&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2&amp;as_vis=1&amp;oi=</a>.</li>
                        <li>Read <em class="emphasis">Garnett v. State</em>, 632 A.2d 797 (1993). In <em class="emphasis">Garnett</em>, the defendant, an intellectually disabled twenty-year-old, had sexual intercourse with a thirteen-year-old girl whom he believed to be sixteen, and was prosecuted for statutory rape. Did the Court of Appeals of Maryland reverse the trial court and allow the defendant to assert <strong class="emphasis bold">mistake of fact</strong> (the victim’s age) as a defense? Why or why not?
