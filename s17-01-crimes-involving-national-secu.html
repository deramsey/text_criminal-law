        <p class="para editable block" id="storm_1.0-ch13_s01_s01_p01">Article III § 3 of the US Constitution defines <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">treason</a><span class="glossdef">Levying war against the United States or adhering to the enemy by providing the enemy with aid and comfort.</span></span> and specifies the evidentiary requirements for any treason trial. The founding fathers wanted to ensure that the government would not charge an individual with treason without significant and reliable proof. Treason was punishable by death in England, so it was a constant threat to anyone who disagreed with the ruling party. Although the treason clause in the Constitution is modeled after the early English law defining treason, it omits a section that criminalized “imagining the death of the King” and also limits Congress’s authority to extend or expand the crime of treason or to lighten the evidentiary requirements.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="storm_1.0-ch13_s01_s01_p02">The pertinent section of the Constitution states, “Treason against the United States shall consist only in levying War against them, or, in adhering to their Enemies, giving them Aid and Comfort. No Person shall be convicted of Treason unless on the Testimony of two Witnesses to the same overt Act, or on Confession in open Court.”</p>

                <p class="para editable block" id="storm_1.0-ch13_s01_s01_s01_s01_p01">Benedict is identified as a person of interest in a treason case. A government agent posing as an enemy spy invites Benedict to dinner, and they discuss the decline of the United States and whether or not they should “do something about it.” At the conclusion of the dinner, Benedict picks up the tab. Thereafter, Benedict is arrested for treason and refuses to incriminate himself by responding to law enforcement interrogation. It is unlikely that Benedict will be convicted of treason in this case. Benedict paid for the government agent’s dinner, which could constitute providing <strong class="emphasis bold">aid</strong> to the enemy. However, Benedict indicated a hesitancy to take further action, which does not satisfy the requirement that he act with the <strong class="emphasis bold">specific intent</strong> or <strong class="emphasis bold">purposely</strong> to <em class="emphasis">betray</em> the United States. In addition, only the government agent can testify as to Benedict’s act of paying for a meal because Benedict is asserting his right to remain silent. Therefore, the constitutional requirement that two witnesses testify about the overt act charged as treason is not satisfied. The intent element and evidentiary requirement for treason are lacking, so Benedict probably will not be subject to prosecution for and conviction of this offense.</p>

Originally part of one of the early versions of the Sedition Act of 1918, the crime of espionage has a colorful history and many interesting criminal prosecutions similar to criminal sabotage. Federal espionage statutes criminalize various acts, depending on whether the conduct occurs during <em class="emphasis">peace</em> or during <em class="emphasis">war</em>. During times of peace, it is criminal espionage to gather, transmit, or attempt to gather or transmit defense information (<strong class="emphasis bold">criminal act</strong>) with <strong class="emphasis bold">general intent</strong> or <strong class="emphasis bold">knowingly</strong>, or with the <strong class="emphasis bold">specific intent</strong> or <strong class="emphasis bold">purposely</strong> that it will be used to damage the United States or assist any foreign nation.<span class="footnote" id="storm_1.0-fn13_012">18 U.S.C. § 793, accessed May 1, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/718/usc_sec_18_00000793----000-.html">http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/718/usc_sec_18_00000793----000-.html</a>.</span> During times of war, it is criminal espionage to collect, record, publish, or communicate information about military activities or to attempt any of the foregoing (<strong class="emphasis bold">criminal act</strong>) with the <strong class="emphasis bold">specific intent</strong> or <strong class="emphasis bold">purposely</strong> that the information will be transmitted to the enemy.<span class="footnote" id="storm_1.0-fn13_013">18 U.S.C. § 794(b), accessed May 1, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/718/usc_sec_18_00000794----000-.html">http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/718/usc_sec_18_00000794----000-.html</a>.</span> Espionage is graded as a <strong class="emphasis bold">felony</strong>, with potential sentencing of life in prison or the death penalty.<span class="footnote" id="storm_1.0-fn13_014">18 U.S.C. § 792 et seq., accessed May 1, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/718/usc_sup_01_18_10_I_20_37.html">http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/718/usc_sup_01_18_10_I_20_37.html</a>.</span></p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="storm_1.0-ch13_s01_s04_s01_p01">Review the example given in <a class="xref" href="#storm_1.0-ch13_s01_s03_s01">Section 13 "Example of Sabotage"</a> with Mo and his computer hacking. Change the example so that before Mo damages the US Department of Defense computer system, he copies some information from different top-secret sites and sends them to operatives in an enemy nation with this message: “I have stolen this information directly from the US Department of Defense. I have also disabled their computer system, which will probably take some time to repair. Now is an excellent time to attack the United States.” He thereafter severely damages the computer system. In this example, Mo has most likely committed both sabotage and espionage. As stated in <a class="xref" href="#storm_1.0-ch13_s01_s03_s01">Section 13 "Example of Sabotage"</a>, Mo probably committed sabotage when he <strong class="emphasis bold">damaged</strong> national defense material with the <strong class="emphasis bold">specific intent</strong> or <strong class="emphasis bold">purposely</strong> to interfere with the nation’s security and defense. When Mo copied top-secret information and sent it to an enemy nation, along with informing the nation that the US Department of Defense computer system was disabled, he <strong class="emphasis bold">gathered</strong> and <strong class="emphasis bold">transmitted</strong> information with the <strong class="emphasis bold">specific intent</strong> or <strong class="emphasis bold">purposely</strong> that it be used to injure the United States. Thus Mo has probably committed both sabotage and espionage and may be subject to prosecution for and conviction of these offenses.</p>

                    <li>The criminal act element required for treason is levying war against the United States or adhering to the enemy by giving the enemy aid and comfort. The criminal intent element required for treason is most likely the general intent or knowingly to commit an act of levying war, or the specific intent or purposely to betray the United States by giving aid and comfort to enemies. Treason also has the constitutional evidentiary requirement that two witnesses corroborate the acts of treason or that the defendant confess in open court. Treason is graded as a felony.</li>
                    <li>The criminal act element required for sedition is advocating, aiding, teaching, organizing, or printing, publishing, or circulating written matter that advocates, aids, or teaches the overthrow of the US government by force or violence. The criminal intent element required for sedition is the general intent or knowingly to advocate, aid, teach, or organize or the specific intent or purposely to print, publish, or circulate written matter that advocates, aids, or teaches the forceful or violent government overthrow. Sedition is graded as a felony.</li>
                    <li>The criminal act and harm elements required for sabotage vary but are generally damaging, destroying, or producing defective property that impedes the US national defense or ability to participate in or prepare for war. The criminal intent element required for sabotage also varies but is either specific intent or purposely, general intent or knowingly, or negligent intent, depending on the criminal act. Some forms of sabotage require the attendant circumstance that the conduct occurs during wartime or a national emergency. Sabotage is graded as a felony.</li>
                    <li>Espionage is spying (criminal act) with general intent or knowingly, or the specific intent or purposely to transmit information to another nation. Some forms of espionage require the attendant circumstance that the conduct occurs during wartime. Espionage is graded as a felony.</li>
