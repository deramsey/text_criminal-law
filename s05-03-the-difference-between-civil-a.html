    <p class="para editable block" id="storm_1.0-ch01_s03_p01">Law can be classified in a variety of ways. One of the most general classifications divides law into civil and criminal. A basic definition of civil law is “the body of law having to do with the private rights of individuals.”<span class="footnote" id="storm_1.0-fn01_002">Yourdictionary.com, “Definition of Civil Law,” accessed August 16, 2010, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.yourdictionary.com/civil-law">http://www.yourdictionary.com/civil-law</a>.</span> As this definition indicates, civil law is between individuals, not <em class="emphasis">the government</em>. Criminal law involves regulations enacted and enforced by government action, while civil law provides a remedy for individuals who need to enforce private rights against other individuals. Some examples of civil law are family law, wills and trusts, and contract law. If individuals need to resolve a <em class="emphasis">civil dispute</em>, this is called <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">civil litigation</a><span class="glossdef">A legal action between individuals to resolve a civil dispute.</span></span>, or a civil lawsuit. When the type of civil litigation involves an injury, the injury action is called a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">tort</a><span class="glossdef">A civil litigation matter that seeks to compensate a victim for an injury.</span></span>.</p>
    <div class="section" id="storm_1.0-ch01_s03_s01">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Characteristics of Civil Litigation</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="storm_1.0-ch01_s03_s01_p01">It is important to distinguish between civil litigation and <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">criminal prosecution</a><span class="glossdef">A legal action where the government prosecutes a defendant to protect the public.</span></span>. Civil and criminal cases share the same courts, but they have very different goals, purposes, and results. Sometimes, one set of facts gives way to a civil lawsuit <em class="emphasis">and</em> a criminal prosecution. This does not violate double jeopardy and is actually quite common.</p>
        <div class="section" id="storm_1.0-ch01_s03_s01_s01">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Parties in Civil Litigation</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="storm_1.0-ch01_s03_s01_s01_p01">In civil litigation, an injured party sues to receive a court-ordered remedy, such as money, property, or some sort of performance. Anyone who is injured—an individual, corporation, or other business entity—can sue civilly. In a civil litigation matter, the injured party that is suing is called the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">plaintiff</a><span class="glossdef">The individual suing in a civil litigation matter.</span></span>. A plaintiff must hire and pay for an attorney or represent himself or herself. Hiring an attorney is one of the many costs of litigation and should be carefully contemplated before jumping into a lawsuit.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="storm_1.0-ch01_s03_s01_s01_p02">The alleged wrongdoer and the person or entity being sued are called the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">defendant</a><span class="glossdef">The alleged wrongdoer in a civil litigation matter and a criminal prosecution.</span></span>. While the term <em class="emphasis">plaintiff</em> is always associated with civil litigation, the wrongdoer is called a defendant in <em class="emphasis">both</em> civil litigation and a criminal prosecution, so this can be confusing. The defendant can be any person or thing that has caused harm, including an individual, corporation, or other business entity. A defendant in a civil litigation matter must hire and pay for an attorney <em class="emphasis">even if that defendant did nothing wrong</em>. The right to a free attorney does not apply in civil litigation, so a defendant who cannot afford an attorney must represent himself or herself.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section" id="storm_1.0-ch01_s03_s01_s02">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Goal of Civil Litigation</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="storm_1.0-ch01_s03_s01_s02_p01">The <em class="emphasis">goal</em> of civil litigation is to <em class="emphasis">compensate the plaintiff</em> for any injuries and to put the plaintiff back in the position that person held before the injury occurred. This goal produces interesting results. It occasionally creates liability or an obligation to pay when there is no fault on behalf of the defendant. The goal is to make the plaintiff whole, not to punish, so <em class="emphasis">fault</em> is not really an issue. If the defendant has the resources to pay, sometimes the law requires the defendant to pay so that society does not bear the cost of the plaintiff’s injury.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="storm_1.0-ch01_s03_s01_s02_p02">A defendant may be liable without fault in two situations. First, the law that the defendant violated may not require fault. Usually, this is referred to as <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">strict liability</a><span class="glossdef">Liability without intent.</span></span>. Strict liability torts do not require fault because they do not include an intent component. Strict liability and other intent issues are discussed in detail in <a class="xref" href="storm_1.0-ch04#storm_1.0-ch04">Chapter 4 "The Elements of a Crime"</a>. Another situation where the defendant may be liable without fault is if the defendant did not actually commit any act but is associated with the acting defendant through a <em class="emphasis">special relationship</em>. The policy of holding a separate entity or individual liable for the defendant’s action is called <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">vicarious liability</a><span class="glossdef">The transfer of a defendant’s liability based upon a special relationship.</span></span>. An example of vicarious liability is employer-employee liability, also referred to as <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">respondeat superior</a><span class="glossdef">A doctrine that holds the employer civilly liable for an employee’s conduct while on the job.</span></span>. If an employee injures a plaintiff while on the job, the <em class="emphasis">employer</em> may be liable for the plaintiff’s injuries, whether or not the employer is at fault. Clearly, between the employer and the employee, the employer generally has the better ability to pay.</p>

            <h2 class="title editable block">Example of Respondeat Superior</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="storm_1.0-ch01_s03_s01_s03_p01">Chris begins the first day at his new job as a cashier at a local McDonald’s restaurant. Chris attempts to multitask and pour hot coffee while simultaneously handing out change. He loses his grip on the coffee pot and spills steaming-hot coffee on his customer Geoff’s hand. In this case, Geoff can sue <em class="emphasis">McDonald’s and Chris</em> if he sustains injuries. McDonald’s is not technically at fault, but it may be liable for Geoff’s injuries under a theory of respondeat superior.</p>

        <div class="section" id="storm_1.0-ch01_s03_s01_s04">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Harm Requirement</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="storm_1.0-ch01_s03_s01_s04_p01">The goal of civil litigation is to compensate the plaintiff for injuries, so the plaintiff must be a bona fide <strong class="emphasis bold">victim</strong> that can prove <strong class="emphasis bold">harm</strong>. If there is no evidence of harm, the plaintiff has no basis for the civil litigation matter. An example would be when a defendant rear-ends a plaintiff in an automobile accident without causing damage to the vehicle (property damage) or physical injury. Even if the defendant is at fault for the automobile accident, the plaintiff cannot sue because the plaintiff does not need compensation for any injuries or losses.</p>

        <div class="section" id="storm_1.0-ch01_s03_s01_s05">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Damages</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="storm_1.0-ch01_s03_s01_s05_p01">Often the plaintiff sues the defendant for money rather than a different, performance-oriented remedy. In a civil litigation matter, any money the court awards to the plaintiff is called <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">damages</a><span class="glossdef">Money the court awards the plaintiff in a civil litigation matter.</span></span>. Several kinds of damages may be appropriate. The plaintiff can sue for <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">compensatory damages</a><span class="glossdef">Damages that compensate the plaintiff for injury.</span></span>, which compensate for injuries, <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">costs</a><span class="glossdef">Damages that reimburse the plaintiff for money spent on the civil lawsuit.</span></span>, which repay the lawsuit expenses, and in some cases, <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">punitive damages</a><span class="glossdef">Damages designed to punish the defendant.</span></span>. Punitive damages, also referred to as <strong class="emphasis bold">exemplary damages</strong>, are <em class="emphasis">not</em> designed to compensate the plaintiff but instead focus on <em class="emphasis">punishing</em> the defendant for causing the injury.<span class="footnote" id="storm_1.0-fn01_003"><em class="emphasis">BMW of North America, Inc. v.

        <p class="para editable block" id="storm_1.0-ch01_s03_s02_p01">A criminal prosecution takes place after a defendant violates a federal or state criminal statute, or in some jurisdictions, after a defendant commits a common-law crime.

            <p class="para editable block" id="storm_1.0-ch01_s03_s02_s01_p01">The government institutes the criminal prosecution, rather than an individual plaintiff. If the defendant commits a federal crime, <strong class="emphasis bold">the United States of America</strong> pursues the criminal prosecution. If the defendant commits a state crime, the state government, often called the <strong class="emphasis bold">People of the State</strong> pursues the criminal prosecution.

            <p class="para editable block" id="storm_1.0-ch01_s03_s02_s02_p01">The defendant in a criminal prosecution can be represented by a private attorney or a <em class="emphasis">free</em> attorney paid for by the state or federal government if he or she is <em class="emphasis">unable to afford attorney’s fees</em> and <em class="emphasis">facing incarceration</em>.<span class="footnote" id="storm_1.0-fn01_006"><em class="emphasis">Alabama v.

The court appoints a free attorney to represent the defendant in a criminal prosecution because <em class="emphasis">the Constitution is in effect</em> in any criminal proceeding. The Constitution provides for the assistance of counsel in the Sixth Amendment, so <em class="emphasis">every</em> criminal defendant facing incarceration has the right to legal representation, regardless of wealth.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="storm_1.0-ch01_s03_s02_s02_p02">The presence of the Constitution at every phase of a criminal prosecution changes the proceedings significantly from the civil lawsuit.

            <h2 class="title editable block">Goal of a Criminal Prosecution</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="storm_1.0-ch01_s03_s02_s03_p01">Another substantial difference between civil litigation and criminal prosecution is the <em class="emphasis">goal</em>. Recall that the goal of civil litigation is to compensate the plaintiff for injuries. In contrast, the goal of a criminal prosecution is to <em class="emphasis">punish</em> the defendant.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="storm_1.0-ch01_s03_s02_s03_p02">One consequence of the goal of punishment in a criminal prosecution is that <em class="emphasis">fault</em> is almost always an element in any criminal proceeding. This is unlike civil litigation, where the ability to pay is a priority consideration. Clearly, it is unfair to punish a defendant who did nothing wrong. This makes criminal law justice oriented and very satisfying for most students.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="storm_1.0-ch01_s03_s02_s03_p03">Injury and a victim are <em class="emphasis">not</em> necessary components of a criminal prosecution because punishment is the objective, and there is no plaintiff. Thus behavior can be criminal even if it is essentially harmless. Society does not condone or pardon conduct simply because it fails to produce a tangible loss.</p>

            <h2 class="title editable block">Examples of Victimless and Harmless Crimes</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="storm_1.0-ch01_s03_s02_s04_p01">Steven is angry because his friend Bob broke his skateboard. Steven gets his gun, which has a silencer on it, and puts it in the glove compartment of his car. He then begins driving to Bob’s house. While Steven is driving, he exceeds the speed limit on three different occasions. Steven arrives at Bob’s house and then he hides in the bushes by the mailbox and waits. After an hour, Bob opens the front door and walks to the mailbox. Bob gets his mail, turns around, and begins walking back to the house. Steven shoots at Bob three different times but misses, and the bullets end up landing in the dirt. Bob does not notice the shots because of the silencer.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="storm_1.0-ch01_s03_s02_s04_p02">In this example, Steven has committed several crimes: (1) If Steven does not have a special permit to carry a concealed weapon, putting the gun in his glove compartment is probably a crime in most states. (2) If Steven does not have a special permit to own a silencer for his gun, this is probably a crime in most states. (3) If Steven does not put the gun in a locked container when he transports it, this is probably a crime in most states. (4) Steven committed a crime each time he exceeded the speed limit. (5) Each time Steven shot at Bob and missed, he probably committed the crime of attempted murder or assault with a deadly weapon in most states. Notice that none of the crimes Steven committed caused any discernible harm. However, common sense dictates that Steven should be punished so he does not commit a criminal act in the future that <em class="emphasis">may</em> result in harm.</p>

                    <li>Jerry, a law enforcement officer, pulls Juanita over for speeding. When Jerry begins writing Juanita’s traffic ticket, she starts to berate him and accuse him of racial profiling. Jerry surreptitiously reaches into his pocket and activates a tape recorder. Juanita later calls the highway patrol where Jerry works and files a false complaint against Jerry. Jerry sues Juanita for $500 in small claims court for filing the false report. He uses the tape recording as evidence. Is this a <strong class="emphasis bold">civil litigation matter</strong> or a <strong class="emphasis bold">criminal prosecution</strong>?</li>
