        <h2 class="title editable block">Synopsis of the History of Rape and Sodomy</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="storm_1.0-ch10_s01_s01_p01">The word <strong class="emphasis bold">rape</strong> has its roots in the Latin word <em class="emphasis">rapere</em>, which means to steal or seize. At early common law, rape was a capital offense. The elements of rape were forcible sexual intercourse, by a man, with a woman not the spouse of the perpetrator, conducted without consent, or with consent obtained by force or threat of force.<span class="footnote" id="storm_1.0-fn10_001">Donna Macnamara, “History of Sexual Violence,” Interactive theatre.org website, accessed February 8, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.interactivetheatre.org/resc/history.html">http://www.interactivetheatre.org/resc/history.html</a>.</span> The rape prosecution required evidence of the defendant’s use of force, extreme resistance by the victim, and evidence that corroborated the rape victim’s testimony. The common law also recognized the crime of <strong class="emphasis bold">sodomy</strong>. In general, sodomy was the penetration of the male anus by a man. Sodomy was condemned and criminalized even <em class="emphasis">with consent</em> because of religious beliefs deeming it a crime against nature.<span class="footnote" id="storm_1.0-fn10_002">“Sex Offenses,” Lawbrain.com website, accessed February 8, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://lawbrain.com/wiki/Sex_Offenses">http://lawbrain.com/wiki/Sex_Offenses</a>.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="storm_1.0-ch10_s01_s01_p02">In the 1970s, many changes were made to rape statutes, updating the antiquated common-law approach and increasing the chances of conviction. The most prominent changes were eliminating the marital rape exemption and the requirement of evidence to corroborate the rape victim’s testimony, creating rape shield laws to protect the victim, and relaxing the necessity for the defendant’s use of force or resistance by the victim.<span class="footnote" id="storm_1.0-fn10_003">Matthew R. Lyon, “No means No? Withdrawal of Consent During Intercourse and the Continuing Evolution of the Definition of Rape,” Findarticles.com website, accessed February 8, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_hb6700/is_1_95/ai_n29148498/pg_3/?tag=content;col1">http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_hb6700/is_1_95/ai_n29148498/pg_3/?tag=content;col1</a>.</span> Many jurisdictions also changed the name of rape to sexual battery, sexual assault, or unlawful sexual conduct and combined sexual offenses like rape, sodomy, and oral copulation into one statute. Although some states still have statutes that provide the death penalty for rape, the US Supreme Court has held that rape, even <em class="emphasis">child rape</em>, cannot be considered a <strong class="emphasis bold">capital</strong> offense without violating the Eighth Amendment cruel and unusual punishment clause, rendering these statutes unenforceable.<span class="footnote" id="storm_1.0-fn10_004"><em class="emphasis">Kennedy v.

        <p class="para editable block" id="storm_1.0-ch10_s01_s01_p03">Sodomy law has likewise been updated to make sodomy a gender-neutral offense and preclude the criminalization of consensual sexual conduct between adults. The US Supreme Court has definitively held that consensual sex between adults may be protected by a right of privacy and cannot be criminalized without a sufficient government interest.<span class="footnote" id="storm_1.0-fn10_005"><em class="emphasis">Lawrence v.

Brad tells Alex he is going to go the store and purchase some beer. While Brad is gone, Alex turns to Brandy, pulls a knife out of his pocket, and tells her to take off her pants and lie down. Brandy tells Alex, “No, I don’t want to,” but thereafter acquiesces, and Alex puts his penis into Brandy’s vagina. Alex has probably committed the criminal act element required for rape in most jurisdictions. Although Alex did not use physical force to accomplish sexual intercourse, his <em class="emphasis">threat</em> of force by display of the knife is sufficient. If the situation is reversed, and Brandy pulls out the knife and orders Alex to put his penis in her vagina, many jurisdictions would also criminalize Brandy’s criminal act as rape. If Alex does not use force or a threat of force, but Brandy is only nine years old, some jurisdictions still criminalize Alex’s act as rape, as would the Model Penal Code.</p>

It can also be present when there is a discrepancy in size or age between the defendant and the victim or if the sexual encounter takes place in an isolated location. The Model Penal Code considers it a felony of the third degree and gross sexual imposition when a male has sexual intercourse with a female not his wife by compelling “her to submit by any threat that would prevent resistance by a woman of ordinary resolution” (Model Penal Code § 213.1(2)(a)).

        <p class="para editable block" id="storm_1.0-ch10_s01_s10_p01">Based on a public awareness that sex offenders often reoffend, many states have enacted some form of <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Megan’s law</a><span class="glossdef">A statute requiring sex offender registration and notification to the public of the location of a sex offender.</span></span> or <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Jessica’s law</a><span class="glossdef">A statute requiring monitoring of a sex offender.</span></span>, which provide for registration, monitoring, control, and elevated sentencing for sex offenders, including those that harm children. Both laws were written and enacted after high-profile cases with child victims became the subject of enormous media attention. Megan’s and Jessica’s law statutes enhance previously enacted statutes that require the registration of sex offenders with local law enforcement agencies.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="storm_1.0-ch10_s01_s10_p02">Typically, a Megan’s law statute provides for registration and notification to the public that a convicted sex offender lives in their area.<span class="footnote" id="storm_1.0-fn10_065">42 Pa.

            <ul class="itemizedlist" id="storm_1.0-ch10_s01_s10_l01">
                <li>Common-law rape was a capital offense, did not include rape of a spouse, required extreme resistance by the victim, and required evidence to corroborate a victim’s testimony. Modern statutes do not make rape a capital offense, often criminalize spousal rape, and do not require extreme resistance by the victim or evidence to corroborate the victim’s testimony. At early common law, sodomy was the anal penetration of a man, by a man. Modern statutes make sodomy gender-neutral and only criminalize sodomy without consent.</li>
                <li>The criminal act element required for rape is sexual penetration accomplished with force or threat of force in many jurisdictions.</li>
                <li>The attendant circumstance element required for rape is lack of consent by the victim.</li>
                <li>In many jurisdictions, the victim does not need to resist if the defendant uses force. If the victim is faced with a threat of force rather than force, the victim need not resist if he or she has a subjective fear of serious bodily injury, and this fear is reasonable under the circumstances.</li>
                <li>In modern times, a victim’s testimony does not need to be corroborated by other evidence to convict a defendant of rape.</li>
                <li>The criminal intent element required for rape is general intent or knowingly to commit the criminal act.</li>
                <li>In some jurisdictions, the criminal intent element required for the rape attendant circumstance is negligent intent—providing for a defense of mistake of fact as to the victim’s consent. In other jurisdictions, the criminal intent element required for the rape attendant circumstance is strict liability, which does not allow for the mistake of fact defense.</li>
                <li>The harm element required for rape is penetration, no matter how slight. Ejaculation is not a requirement for rape in most jurisdictions.</li>
                <li>Rape shield laws generally preclude the admission of evidence of the victim’s past sexual conduct in a rape trial, unless it is allowed by a judge at an in camera hearing. Rape shield laws also preclude the admission of evidence of the victim’s style of dress and the victim’s request that the defendant wear a condom to prove victim consent. Some rape shield laws provide that the victim’s testimony need not be corroborated by other evidence to convict the defendant of rape.</li>
                <li>Acquaintance rape often goes unreported and does not necessarily include use of force by the defendant or resistance by the victim.</li>
                <li>States that criminalize spousal rape generally require the same elements for spousal rape as for rape and grade spousal rape the same as rape.</li>
                <li>Statutory rape is generally sexual intercourse with a victim who is under the age of legal consent. Statutory rape does not have the requirement that the intercourse be forcible and does not require the attendant circumstance of the victim’s lack of consent because the victim is incapable of rendering legal consent. In the majority of jurisdictions, the criminal intent element required for statutory rape is strict liability. In a minority of jurisdictions, the criminal intent element required for statutory rape is negligent or reckless intent, providing for a defense of mistake of fact as to the victim’s age.</li>
                <li>Sodomy has the same elements as rape except for the criminal act element, which is often defined as forcible penis to anus penetration, rather than penis to vagina penetration. In addition, in some states sodomy is criminal with consent when it occurs in a state prison or a local detention facility or jail. Oral copulation also has the same elements as rape, except for the criminal act element, which is forcible mouth to sexual organ or anus penetration. Incest is sexual intercourse between family members who cannot legally marry.</li>
                <li>Generally, rape, sodomy, and oral copulation are graded as serious felonies. Factors that enhance grading of sex offenses are penetration, gang rape, bodily injury, the use of a weapon, a victim who has intellectual or mental disabilities or is youthful or intoxicated, and the commission of other crimes in concert with the sex offense. Sex offenses committed with the victim’s consent and without penetration are typically graded lower. If the victim is below the age of consent, a large age difference exists between the defendant and the victim, the defendant is an adult, or the victim is of tender years, grading typically is enhanced.</li>
                <li>Typically, a Megan’s law statute provides for sex offender registration and notification to the public that a convicted sex offender lives in their area. A Jessica’s law statute often includes a stay-away order mandating that a sex offender cannot live within a certain distance from areas such as a school or park where children tend to congregate. Jessica’s law statutes also provide for GPS monitoring and extend the sentencing and parole terms of child sex offenders.</li>

                <li>Jorge and Christina have consensual sexual intercourse. Could this consensual sexual intercourse be criminal? Which crime(s), if any, could exist in this fact pattern?</li>
                <li>Read <em class="emphasis">Toomer v. State</em>, 529 SE 2d 719 (2000). In <em class="emphasis">Toomer</em>, the defendant was convicted of rape after having sexual intercourse with his daughter, who was under the age of fourteen. The jury instruction did not include any requirement for the defendant’s use of force or victim resistance. The defendant appealed and claimed that the prosecution should have proven he used force and the victim’s resistance because the charge was <strong class="emphasis bold">rape</strong>, not <strong class="emphasis bold">statutory rape</strong>. Did the Supreme Court of South Carolina uphold the defendant’s conviction? Why or why not? The case is available at this link: <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=3593808516097562509&amp;q=Toomer+v.+State&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2,5">http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=3593808516097562509&amp;q= Toomer+v.+State&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2,5</a>.</li>
                <li>Read <em class="emphasis">Fleming v. State</em>, 323 SW 3d 540 (2010). In <em class="emphasis">Fleming</em>, the defendant appealed his conviction for aggravated sexual assault of a child under fourteen because he was not allowed to present a mistake of age defense. The defendant claimed that the requirement of strict liability intent as to the age of the victim deprived him of <strong class="emphasis bold">due process of law</strong>. Did the Court of Appeals of Texas agree with the defendant?
