    <p class="para editable block" id="storm_1.0-ch12_s01_p01">Crimes against the public include offenses that affect the quality of life, group violence such as gang activity, and vice crimes. Because quality-of-life crimes are often based on <em class="emphasis">moral</em> or <em class="emphasis">value</em> judgments, these offenses tend to target the poor and downtrodden. If the conduct prohibited involves an individual’s <strong class="emphasis bold">status</strong> in society, <strong class="emphasis bold">assembling</strong>, or <strong class="emphasis bold">speech</strong>, the First and Fourteenth Amendments require a narrowly tailored statute supported by a compelling government interest. This creates a conflict between legislators trying to ensure peace and tranquility for citizens and judges upholding the many individual protections included in the Bill of Rights.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="storm_1.0-ch12_s01_p02">The quality-of-life offenses discussed are disorderly conduct, vagrancy, and loitering. Upcoming sections analyze crimes involving group activity, such as unlawful assembly and riot, along with the ever-growing problem of criminal gangs, and novel criminal and civil responses. The final section of this chapter discusses common vice crimes, including possession, sale, and use of controlled substances and prostitution.</p>

                <p class="para editable block" id="storm_1.0-ch12_s01_s01_s01_s01_p01">David and Daniel leave a party in a quiet neighborhood at three in the morning. Both are inebriated. After walking a couple of blocks and telling stories, they begin singing loudly with their arms wrapped around each other. David stumbles and trips Daniel, who falls heavily to the sidewalk. Daniel gets up and starts screaming and swearing at David, challenging him to fight. David yells back, “Bring it on!” David pushes Daniel, he pushes back, and they begin punching and kicking. In this instance, David and Daniel have probably committed <em class="emphasis">three</em> separate disorderly conduct offenses. When David and Daniel began singing at three in the morning on a quiet street, they made a loud and unreasonable noise. When they challenged each other to fight, they uttered threats or stated fighting words. When they engaged in a fistfight, they committed fighting, or created a hazardous condition. Thus David and Daniel are most likely subject to a prosecution for and conviction of three counts of disorderly conduct in many jurisdictions.</p>

However, not all speech is protected under the First Amendment.

                <p class="para editable block" id="storm_1.0-ch12_s01_s01_s04_s01_p01">A state legislature enacts a disorderly conduct statute that prohibits “making rude and annoying comments to another.” This statute is most unlikely unconstitutional under the First and Fourteenth Amendments. The words <em class="emphasis">rude</em> and <em class="emphasis">annoying</em> are ambiguous, which could lead to uneven application by law enforcement and a failure to provide adequate notice to the public of what is criminal. Therefore, the statute can be stricken as <strong class="emphasis bold">void for vagueness</strong>. In addition, rude and annoying comments are not necessarily fighting words, true threats, or obscenity, so they could be protected under the First Amendment. This means that the statute could also be stricken as <strong class="emphasis bold">overbroad</strong> because it includes protected and unprotected conduct within its parameters. For a fuller and more detailed description of void for vagueness and overbreadth constitutional challenges, please refer to <a class="xref" href="storm_1.0-ch03#storm_1.0-ch03">Chapter 3 "Constitutional Protections"</a>.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Vagrancy and Loitering</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="storm_1.0-ch12_s01_s02_p01">Although the government technically does not have an interest in punishing individuals for who they are, such as an impoverished person or a transient, the public perception of law enforcement is often affected by the presence of so-called vagrants and panhandlers in any given area. Thus virtually every jurisdiction has statutes punishing either <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">vagrancy</a><span class="glossdef">A quality-of-life crime that prohibits immoral and illegitimate behavior.</span></span> or <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">loitering</a><span class="glossdef">Loitering, wandering, or remaining in specified locations for the purpose of committing a crime or for another illegitimate reason.</span></span>. However, these statutes are subject to constitutional attack if they are <strong class="emphasis bold">void for vagueness</strong>, <strong class="emphasis bold">overbroad</strong>, or target <strong class="emphasis bold">status</strong>.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="storm_1.0-ch12_s01_s02_p02">Historically, vagrancy statutes were broadly drafted to allow law enforcement considerable discretion in arresting the unemployed, gamblers, drug addicts, alcoholics, and those who frequented houses of prostitution or other locations of ill repute. In a sense, vagrancy statutes attempted to incapacitate individuals <em class="emphasis">before</em> they engaged in criminal activity, to ensure the safety and security of any given area.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="storm_1.0-ch12_s01_s02_p03">In 1972, the US Supreme Court struck down a Florida vagrancy statute in <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://supreme.justia.com/us/405/156/"><em class="emphasis">Papachristou v. City of Jacksonville</em></a>, 405 U.S. 156 (1972). The Court held that the statute, which prohibited night walking, living off one’s spouse, and frequenting bars or liquor stores was void for vagueness and violated the due process clause in the Fourteenth Amendment. Thereafter, many states repealed or modified vagrancy statutes in lieu of more precisely drafted statutes prohibiting specific criminal conduct such as loitering. The Model Penal Code prohibits public drunkenness and drug incapacitation (Model Penal Code § 250.5) and loitering or prowling (Model Penal Code § 250.6).

            <p class="para editable block" id="storm_1.0-ch12_s01_s02_s01_p01">One modern statutory approach to preventing homeless individuals and transients from congregating in cities and affecting the quality of life or the prosperity of businesses and tourism are <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">sit-lie laws</a><span class="glossdef">Statutes and ordinances that prohibit sitting or lying on a public sidewalk or street.</span></span>. Sit-lie laws prohibit sitting or lying on public streets and sidewalks and thereby encourage individuals to move about, rather than block access to businesses, roadways, or transportation facilities. If precisely drafted, sit-lie laws could resemble constitutional <strong class="emphasis bold">loitering</strong> statutes, substituting sitting or lying down for the criminal act of loitering, wandering, or remaining. However, these statutes are susceptible to the same constitutional challenges as vagrancy and loitering statutes because they target the impoverished, addicts, and the unemployed.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="storm_1.0-ch12_s01_s02_s01_p02">Seattle was the first city in the United States to enact a sit-lie ordinance in 1993 that prohibited sitting or lying on a public sidewalk between the hours of 7 a.m. and 9 p.m. in Seattle’s downtown area. The ordinance was attacked and ultimately upheld by the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in 1996.<span class="footnote" id="storm_1.0-fn12_017">Heather Knight, “San Francisco Looks to Seattle: Did Sidewalk Sitting Ban Help?” seattlepi.com website, accessed April 5, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.seattlepi.com/default/article/San-Francisco-looks-to-Seattle-Did-sidewalk-888774.php">http://www.seattlepi.com/default/article/San-Francisco-looks-to-Seattle-Did-sidewalk-888774.php</a>.</span> Los Angeles thereafter enacted a more comprehensive ordinance that banned sitting, lying, or sleeping on public streets and sidewalks at all times and in all places within Los Angeles city limits. This ordinance was stricken by the same court as unconstitutional <strong class="emphasis bold">cruel and unusual punishment</strong> pursuant to the Eighth Amendment.<span class="footnote" id="storm_1.0-fn12_018"><em class="emphasis">Jones v.

Portland followed Los Angeles with a sidewalk-obstruction ordinance, requiring individuals to keep their personal belongings within two feet of their bodies. This ordinance was stricken as <strong class="emphasis bold">void for vagueness</strong> in 2009.<span class="footnote" id="storm_1.0-fn12_019">Matt Davis, “Sit/Lie Law Unconstitutional,” <em class="emphasis">Portland Mercury</em> website, accessed April 5, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://blogtown.portlandmercury.com/BlogtownPDX/archives/2009/02/19/judge_rules_sit_lie_law_uncons">http://blogtown.portlandmercury.com/BlogtownPDX/archives/2009/02/19/judge_rules_sit_lie_law_uncons</a>.</span></p>

                    <li>The criminal act element required for disorderly conduct is either when the defendant (1) makes a loud and unreasonable noise, obscene utterance, or gesture, (2) engages in fighting or threatening, or states fighting words, or (3) creates a hazardous condition by an act that does not serve a legitimate purpose.</li>
                    <li>The criminal intent element required for disorderly conduct in many jurisdictions is the specific intent or purposely to cause public inconvenience, annoyance, or alarm, or the reckless intent to cause a risk thereof.</li>
                    <li>The disorderly conduct attendant circumstance is that the conduct occurs in a public place.</li>
                    <li>Disorderly conduct statutes can be constitutionally challenged under the First or Fourteenth Amendments as void for vagueness or overbroad.</li>
                    <li>Disorderly conduct is typically graded as a misdemeanor.</li>
                    <li>Vagrancy statutes are subject to constitutional challenges if they are void for vagueness, overbroad, or target status.</li>
                    <li>Loitering statutes are subject to constitutional challenges if they target the unemployed or are void for vagueness.</li>
                    <li>The loitering criminal act element is typically loitering, wandering, or remaining, with the specific intent or purposely to gamble, beg, or engage in prostitution. An attendant circumstance could specify the location the conduct takes place, such as a school or transportation facility. Another common attendant circumstance is being masked in a public place while loitering, with an exception for defendants going to a masquerade party or participating in a public parade. Loitering is typically graded as a misdemeanor or a violation.</li>
                    <li>Sit-lie laws typically prohibit sitting or lying on a public sidewalk or street, instead of loitering, wandering, or remaining like loitering statutes.</li>
