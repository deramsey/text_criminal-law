However, the insanity defense is rarely used and hardly ever successful. This is generally because of the difficulty in proving <em class="emphasis">legal</em> insanity.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="storm_1.0-ch06_s01_p03">Many criminal defendants suffer from mental illness and can produce evidence of this illness such as psychiatric or layperson testimony. Often, mental disturbance is apparent from the defendant’s conduct under the circumstances. However, legal insanity differs from <em class="emphasis">medical</em> insanity and is generally much more difficult to establish. The rationale behind creating a different standard for legal insanity is the goal of a criminal prosecution discussed in <a class="xref" href="storm_1.0-ch01#storm_1.0-ch01">Chapter 1 "Introduction to Criminal Law"</a>. Criminal prosecution should deter as well as incapacitate. While the purpose of a medical diagnosis is to eventually <em class="emphasis">cure</em> the defendant’s disorder, the purpose of criminal law is to <em class="emphasis">punish</em> the defendant. Thus the defendant’s conduct is not excused if the defendant or society can benefit from punishment.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="storm_1.0-ch06_s01_p04">The policy supporting the insanity defense is twofold. First, an insane defendant does not have <em class="emphasis">control</em> over his or her conduct. This is similar to a defendant who is hypnotized, or sleepwalking. Second, an insane defendant does not have the ability to <em class="emphasis">form criminal intent</em>. Without the ability to control conduct, or the understanding that conduct is evil or wrong by society’s standards, an insane defendant presumably will commit crimes again and again. Thus no deterrent effect is served by punishment, and treatment for the mental defect is the appropriate remedy.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="storm_1.0-ch06_s01_p05">Four variations of the insanity defense currently exist: M’Naghten, irresistible impulse, substantial capacity, and Durham.</p>

Also called the right-wrong test.</span></span>, also called the <strong class="emphasis bold">right-wrong test</strong>, is the most common insanity defense in the United States. It is also the oldest and was created in England in 1843. The defense is named after Daniel M’Naghten. M’Naghten was under the paranoid delusion that the Prime Minister of England, Sir Robert Peel, was trying to kill him. When he tried to shoot Sir Peel from behind, he inadvertently shot Sir Peel’s Secretary, Edward Drummond, who thereafter died. M’Naghten was put on trial for murder and, to the shock of the nation, the jury found him not guilty by reason of insanity.<span class="footnote" id="storm_1.0-fn06_003"><em class="emphasis">Queen v. M’Naghten</em>, 10 Clark &amp; F.200, 2 Eng.

        <p class="para editable block" id="storm_1.0-ch06_s01_s01_p02">The M’Naghten insanity defense is <em class="emphasis">cognitive</em> and focuses on the defendant’s awareness, rather than the ability to <em class="emphasis">control</em> conduct. The defense requires two elements. First, the defendant must be suffering from a <em class="emphasis">mental defect</em> at the time he or she commits the criminal act. The mental defect can be called a “defect of reason” or a “disease of the mind,” depending on the jurisdiction.<span class="footnote" id="storm_1.0-fn06_004">Iowa Code § 701.4, accessed November 30, 2010, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://coolice.legis.state.ia.us/cool-ice/default.asp?category=billinfo&amp;service=iowacode&amp;ga=83&amp;input=701">http://coolice.legis.state.ia.us/cool-ice/default.asp?category=billinfo&amp;service=iowacode&amp;ga=83&amp;input=701</a>.</span> Second, the trier of fact must find that because of the mental defect, the defendant did not know either the <em class="emphasis">nature and quality</em> of the criminal act or that the act was <em class="emphasis">wrong</em>.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="storm_1.0-ch06_s01_s01_p03">The terms “defect of reason” and “disease of the mind” can be defined in different ways, but in general, the defendant must be cognitively impaired to the level of not knowing the nature and quality of the criminal act, or that the act is wrong. Some common examples of mental defects and diseases are psychosis, schizophrenia, and paranoia.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="storm_1.0-ch06_s01_s01_p04">Jurisdictions vary as to the level of awareness the defendant must possess.

If appreciate is the standard, the trier of fact must analyze the defendant’s emotional state, and evidence of the defendant’s character or personality may be relevant and admissible.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="storm_1.0-ch06_s01_s01_p05">A defendant does not know the nature and quality of a criminal act if the defendant is completely oblivious to what he or she is doing. This is quite rare, so most defendants claiming insanity choose to assert that they did not know their act was <em class="emphasis">wrong</em>.

        <p class="para editable block" id="storm_1.0-ch06_s01_s03_p02">The substantial capacity test is as follows: “A person is not responsible for criminal conduct if at the time of such conduct as a result of mental disease or defect he lacks substantial capacity either to appreciate the criminality [wrongfulness] of his conduct or to conform his conduct to the requirements of law” (Model Penal Code § 4.01(1)). The defense has two elements. The first element requires the defendant to have a mental disease or defect, like the M’Naghten and irresistible impulse insanity defenses. The second element combines the <strong class="emphasis bold">cognitive</strong> standard with <strong class="emphasis bold">volitional</strong>, like the irresistible impulse insanity defense supplementing the M’Naghten insanity defense.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="storm_1.0-ch06_s01_s03_p03">In general, it is easier to establish insanity under the substantial capacity test because both the cognitive and volitional requirements are scaled down to more flexible standards. Unlike the M’Naghten insanity defense, the substantial capacity test relaxes the requirement for complete inability to understand or know the difference between right and wrong. Instead, the defendant must lack <em class="emphasis">substantial</em>, not total, capacity. The “wrong” in the substantial capacity test is “criminality,” which is a <em class="emphasis">legal</em> rather than moral wrong. In addition, unlike the irresistible impulse insanity defense, the defendant must lack <em class="emphasis">substantial</em>, not total, ability to conform conduct to the requirements of the law. Another difference in the substantial capacity test is the use of the word “appreciate” rather than “know.” As stated previously, appreciate incorporates an emotional quality, which means that evidence of the defendant’s character or personality is relevant and most likely admissible to support the defense.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="storm_1.0-ch06_s01_s03_s01_p01">Loreen has been diagnosed with psychosis and spent most of her life in a mental hospital. While at the mental hospital, Loreen made friends with many of the patients and health-care personnel. From time to time, Loreen would play jokes on these friends. Most of these “jokes” consisted of putting her antidepressants into their food. Loreen was always reprimanded and often sternly punished for these escapades. After her release from the mental hospital at age twenty-one, Loreen falls in love with Aidan, a man who works in a bookstore near her apartment. Loreen decides to make Aidan fall in love with her by feeding him a magic potion, which she concocts out of a mixture of her antidepressants. Loreen buys a book from Aidan and casually asks if he would like her to buy him a coffee. Aidan shrugs and says, “Sure, but I don’t have a break for another two hours.” Loreen offers to bring him the coffee. Before bringing the drink to Aidan, she puts her “magic potion” in it. While Aidan is sipping the coffee, Loreen declares her love for him. She then states, “I know I shouldn’t have, but I put a love potion in your coffee. I hope it doesn’t hurt you.” Aidan becomes seriously ill after drinking the coffee and is hospitalized.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="storm_1.0-ch06_s01_s03_s01_p02">Loreen claims she is not guilty for battering Aidan by reason of insanity. If Loreen is in a jurisdiction that recognizes the substantial capacity test, she may be successful with her claim. Loreen has a mental disease or defect, <strong class="emphasis bold">psychosis</strong>. Loreen’s statement to Aidan indicates that she lacks the <em class="emphasis">substantial</em> capacity to appreciate the criminality of her conduct. Note that if Loreen were in a M’Naghten jurisdiction, her statement “I know I shouldn’t have” could prove her awareness that her conduct was <em class="emphasis">wrong</em>, defeating her claim. In addition, Loreen’s behavior at the mental hospital indicates that she lacks the substantial capacity to conform or control her conduct. Even after a lifetime of being punished over and over for mixing her meds together and putting them in other people’s food or drink, Loreen still does it. Lastly, in a substantial capacity jurisdiction, testimony from Loreen’s friends at the mental hospital may be admissible to support her claim of insanity, and her lack of ability to “appreciate” the criminality of her conduct.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="storm_1.0-ch06_s01_s04_p02">In general, the Durham insanity defense relies on ordinary principles of <strong class="emphasis bold">proximate causation</strong>.

The second element has to do with <strong class="emphasis bold">causation</strong>. If the criminal conduct is “caused” by the mental disease or defect, then the conduct should be excused under the circumstances.</p>

Most psychiatric experts agree that individuals afflicted with paranoia unreasonably believe that the human population is “out to get them.” Arianna works under the direct supervision of Nora, who has a physical condition called “walleye.” Nora’s walleye makes it appear that she is looking to the side when she addresses people. Arianna gradually becomes convinced that Nora is communicating secret messages to their coworkers when she is speaking to Arianna. Arianna is genuinely frightened that Nora is telling their coworkers to kill her, and she decides she needs to defend herself. Arianna brings a gun to work one day, and when Nora begins talking to her about her tendency to take overlong lunches, Arianna pulls the gun out of her cubicle and shoots and kills Nora.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="storm_1.0-ch06_s01_s04_s01_p02">Arianna claims she is not guilty for killing Nora by reason of insanity.

Arianna can probably produce evidence, such as psychiatric expert testimony, that her paranoia “caused” or “produced” her criminal conduct, which was shooting Nora.

If the defendant is mentally incompetent to stand trial, the trial is delayed until the defendant regains competency. Although a detailed discussion of mental competence to stand trial is beyond the scope of this book, in general, a criminal defendant must be able to understand the charges against him or her, and be able to assist in his or her defense. As the Model Penal Code provides, “[n]o person who as a result of mental disease or defect lacks capacity to understand the proceedings against him or to assist in his own defense shall be tried, convicted or sentenced for the commission of an offense so long as such incapacity endures” (Model Penal Code § 4.04).

                    <li>The four states that do not recognize the insanity defense are Montana, Utah, Kansas, and Idaho.</li>
                    <li>The four versions of the insanity defense are M’Naghten, irresistible impulse, substantial capacity, and Durham.</li>
                    <li>
                        <p class="para">The two elements of the M’Naghten insanity defense are the following:</p>
                        <ul class="itemizedlist" id="storm_1.0-ch06_s01_s10_s01_l02">
                            <li>The defendant must be suffering from a mental defect or disease at the time of the crime.</li>
                            <li>The defendant did not know the nature or quality of the criminal act he or she committed or that the act was wrong because of the mental defect or disease.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p class="para">The two elements of the irresistible impulse insanity defense are the following:</p>
                        <ul class="itemizedlist" id="storm_1.0-ch06_s01_s10_s01_l03">
                            <li>The defendant must be suffering from a mental defect or disease at the time of the crime.</li>
                            <li>The defendant could not control his or her criminal conduct because of the mental defect or disease.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>The substantial capacity test softens the second element of the M’Naghten and irresistible impulse insanity defenses. Under the substantial capacity test, the defendant must lack substantial, not total, capacity to appreciate the criminality of conduct or to control or conform conduct to the law.</li>
                    <li>The Durham insanity defense excuses criminal conduct when it is caused by a mental disease or defect.</li>
                    <li>The criminal defendant pleading not guilty by reason of insanity must produce evidence to rebut the presumption that criminal defendants are sane. Thereafter, either the prosecution has the burden of disproving insanity to a certain evidentiary standard or the defendant has the burden of proving insanity to a preponderance of evidence or clear and convincing evidence.</li>
                    <li>The diminished capacity defense is a failure of proof imperfect defense that may reduce a first-degree murder to second-degree murder or manslaughter if the defendant did not have the mental capacity to form first-degree murder criminal intent. The insanity defense is generally a perfect affirmative defense in many jurisdictions.</li>
                    <li>The insanity defense exonerates the defendant from criminal responsibility. Mental incompetence to stand trial delays the criminal trial until mental competency is regained.</li>
                    <li>The guilty but mentally ill verdict finds the criminal defendant guilty but orders him or her to undergo mental health treatment while incarcerated. The insanity defense is generally a perfect affirmative defense in many jurisdictions.</li>
                    <li>The federal government and some states automatically commit a criminal defendant to a mental health facility after an acquittal based on insanity. Other states have a postverdict hearing to rule on commitment.</li>
                    <li>A claim of temporary insanity is the same as a claim of insanity except for the duration of the mental illness.</li>

                    <li>Jeffrey is diagnosed with schizophrenia. For fifteen years, Jeffrey kidnaps, tortures, kills, and eats human victims. Jeffrey avoids detection by hiding his victims’ corpses in various locations throughout the city. If the jurisdiction in which Jeffrey commits these crimes recognizes the M’Naghten insanity defense, can Jeffrey successfully plead and prove insanity? Why or why not?</li>
                    <li>Read <em class="emphasis">State v. Guido</em>, 191 A.2d 45 (1993). In <em class="emphasis">Guido</em>, the defendant killed her husband and claimed insanity in a jurisdiction that recognizes the M’Naghten insanity defense. Psychiatric experts examined the defendant and deemed her legally sane at the time of the killing. The experts thereafter met with the defendant’s attorney and changed their opinion to state that the defendant was legally <em class="emphasis">insane</em> at the time of the killing. The jury found the defendant sane after being made aware of this discrepancy. Did the New Jersey Supreme Court uphold the defendant’s conviction?

The defendant wanted to invalidate South Carolina’s statute recognizing the verdict of guilty but mentally ill as unconstitutional. The defendant claimed that defendants incarcerated after guilty but mentally ill verdicts receive the same mental health treatment as defendants incarcerated under regular guilty verdicts, violating the Fourteenth Amendment due process clause. Did the Supreme Court of South Carolina uphold the statute?
