The window is open, so once Jed removes the screen, he places both hands on the sill, and begins to launch himself upward. The occupant of the residence, who was watching Jed from inside, slams the window down on Jed’s hands. Jed has probably committed the criminal act element required for burglary in many jurisdictions. When Jed removed the window screen, he committed a <strong class="emphasis bold">breaking</strong>. When Jed placed his hands on the windowsill, his fingers intruded into the residence, which satisfies the <strong class="emphasis bold">entry</strong> requirement. Thus Jed may be subject to a prosecution for burglary rather than <em class="emphasis">attempted</em> burglary, even though he never actually damaged or broke the barrier of the residence or managed to gain complete access to the interior.</p>

            <ul class="itemizedlist" id="storm_1.0-ch11_s03_s04_l01">
                <li>The criminal act element required for burglary is breaking and entering, just entering, or remaining.</li>
                <li>The criminal intent element required for burglary is typically the general intent or knowingly to commit the criminal act and the specific intent or purposely to commit a felony, any crime, or a felony, petty, or grand theft once inside the burglarized area.</li>
                <li>Burglary generally includes the attendant circumstances that the area entered is a structure, building, or vehicle belonging to another, or an occupied building or structure, or a dwelling. Modern jurisdictions have eliminated the requirement that the property belong to another and prohibit the defendant from burglarizing his or her own property. Some jurisdictions require a vehicle to be locked, and a few jurisdictions require the burglary to take place at nighttime.</li>
                <li>Burglary is typically graded as a felony that is divided into degrees. First-degree burglary is often a strike in jurisdictions that have three strikes statutes and a predicate felony for first-degree felony murder.</li>
                <li>Typically, criminal trespass is an unauthorized (attendant circumstance) entry or remaining (criminal act) into a building, occupied structure, or place as to which notice against trespassing is given, owned by another (attendant circumstance) with general intent or knowingly that the entry was unauthorized (criminal intent). Criminal trespass is generally graded as a felony, albeit a less serious felony than burglary, or a misdemeanor if the area trespassed is a place rather than an occupied building or structure.</li>
                <li>The criminal act element required for arson is starting a fire, burning, or damaging with fire or explosives specified real or personal property.</li>
                <li>The criminal intent element required for arson is the general intent or knowingly to commit the criminal act in many jurisdictions.</li>
                <li>Arson statutes can specify the attendant circumstance that the defendant burns a specific type of property, such as a dwelling or other real or personal property. In most jurisdictions, if the defendant burns his or her own property, the defendant must act with the specific intent or purposely to defraud, typically an insurance carrier.</li>
                <li>The harm element required for arson is burning, charring, damage, or, in the most extreme cases, smoke damage.</li>
                <li>Arson is typically graded as a felony that is divided into degrees. First-degree arson is often a strike in jurisdictions that have three strikes statutes and a predicate felony for first-degree felony murder. Arson could also carry a registration requirement like serious sex offenses.</li>
                <li>The elements of criminal mischief are damaging or destroying property, tampering with property, or deception or threat that leads to a loss of property (criminal act and harm) with specific intent or purposely, general intent or knowingly, recklessly, or negligently. Although criminal mischief may be a felony in many jurisdictions, it is generally a less serious felony than arson and in some jurisdictions it is graded as a gross misdemeanor or misdemeanor.</li>

                <li>Why is burglary of a <strong class="emphasis bold">dwelling</strong> at <strong class="emphasis bold">nighttime</strong> generally graded higher than other burglaries?</li>
                <li>Read <em class="emphasis">Butler v. Florida</em>, No. 1D08-0958 (Fla: Dist. Court of Appeals, 2009).
