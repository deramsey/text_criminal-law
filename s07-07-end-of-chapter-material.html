        <h3 class="title">Summary</h3>
        <p class="para" id="storm_1.0-ch03_s07_p01">The US Constitution protects criminal defendants from certain statutes and procedures. State constitutions usually mirror the federal and occasionally provide more protection to criminal defendants than the federal Constitution, as long as the state constitutions do not violate federal supremacy. Statutes can be unconstitutional as written or as enforced and must be supported by a sufficient government interest. Statutes that punish without a trial (bills of attainder) or criminal statutes that are applied retroactively (ex post facto) are unconstitutional under Article 1 §§ 9 and 10. Other constitutional protections are in the Bill of Rights, which is the first ten amendments, and the Fourteenth Amendment, which contains the due process clause and the equal protection clause.</p>
        <p class="para" id="storm_1.0-ch03_s07_p02">The due process clause prohibits the government from taking an individual’s life, liberty, or property arbitrarily, without notice and an opportunity to be heard. Statutes that are vague or criminalize constitutionally protected conduct (overbroad) violate due process. The Fifth Amendment due process clause applies to the federal government, and the Fourteenth Amendment due process clause applies to the states. The Fourteenth Amendment due process clause also selectively incorporates fundamental rights from the Bill of Rights and applies them to the states. Rights incorporated and applied to the states are the right to free speech, the right to privacy, the right to bear arms, the right to be free from cruel and unusual punishment, and the right to a jury trial. The Fourteenth Amendment also contains the equal protection clause, which prevents the government from enacting statutes that discriminate without a sufficient government interest.</p>
        <p class="para" id="storm_1.0-ch03_s07_p03">The First Amendment protects speech, expression, and expressive conduct from being criminalized without a compelling government interest and a statute that uses the least restrictive means possible. Some exceptions to the First Amendment are precise statutes targeting fighting words, incitement to riot, hate crimes, obscenity, and nude dancing. The First, Third, Fourth, Fifth, Ninth, and Fourteenth Amendments also create a right to privacy that prevents the government from criminalizing the use of birth control, abortion, or consensual sexual relations.</p>
        <p class="para" id="storm_1.0-ch03_s07_p04">The Second Amendment protects an individual’s right to possess a usable handgun in the home for self-defense. This right is not extended to convicted felons, the mentally ill, commercial sale of firearms, and firearm possession near schools and government buildings. The Eighth Amendment protects criminal defendants from inhumane and excessive punishments. The Sixth Amendment ensures that all facts used to extend a criminal defendant’s sentencing beyond the statutory maximum must be determined by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>

            <li>The <em class="emphasis">categorization</em> of some speech as outside the First Amendment’s protection generally focuses on speech that can produce immediate or imminent harm or lawless action, like <strong class="emphasis bold">fighting words</strong>, or speech that is devoid of social value, like <strong class="emphasis bold">obscenity</strong>. Depictions of animal cruelty probably fall within the second category. Whether you believe depictions of animal cruelty should be criminalized depends on whether you feel another category should be added to the list. The US Supreme Court was reluctant to expand categorization, indicating that First Amendment protections far exceed government interests in content-based regulations.</li>
            <li>Some possible consequences of expanding categorization are the increase of government censorship into areas that may have value, either literary, artistic, political, or scientific. Any time case precedent limits the First Amendment, individual rights of expression are likewise inhibited, and the government’s power to regulate and enact laws encroaching upon individual freedoms is <em class="emphasis">enhanced</em>.</li>

            <li>(1) The <strong class="emphasis bold">ex post facto clause</strong> is relevant. (2) The statute is most likely <strong class="emphasis bold">constitutional</strong>. (3) Even though the statute is retroactive, the statute is not a criminal law, but a tax increase, so there is no violation of the ex post facto clause.</li>
            <li>(1) The <strong class="emphasis bold">First Amendment</strong> and the <strong class="emphasis bold">due process clause</strong> in the Fourteenth Amendment are relevant. (2) The proposed statute is most likely <strong class="emphasis bold">unconstitutional</strong>. (3) The statute is probably void for vagueness and overbroad. The word “art” can be interpreted differently by different people, so it leads to uneven application by law enforcement. The statute also fails to give the public notice of what is criminal. In addition, because the statute criminalizes the display of “art,” it is overbroad and includes expressive works that may have artistic value and are protected under the First Amendment pursuant to the <em class="emphasis">Miller</em> test of obscenity.</li>
            <li>(1) The <strong class="emphasis bold">equal protection clause</strong> of the Fourteenth Amendment is relevant. (2) The proposed statute is most likely <strong class="emphasis bold">constitutional</strong>. (3) The statute discriminates against criminal defendants infected with the AIDS virus. However, this classification has a rational basis and is not arbitrary. The state government has an interest in preventing the spread of AIDS, so the statute will probably be upheld under the equal protection clause, even though it is discriminatory.</li>
            <li>(1) The <strong class="emphasis bold">Second Amendment</strong> and the <strong class="emphasis bold">due process clause</strong> in the Fourteenth Amendment are relevant. (2) The proposed statute is most likely <strong class="emphasis bold">unconstitutional</strong>. (3) The US Supreme Court has held that the Second Amendment, as applied to the states through the Fourteenth Amendment, protects an individual’s right to possess a usable handgun in the home for self-defense. Although the Court held that an exception could be made for convicted felons, the proposed statute covers <em class="emphasis">any</em> crime that involves alcohol, including misdemeanors (such as misdemeanor DUI). Thus it is overbroad and encroaches on the Second Amendment’s guarantee of the right to bear arms.</li>
            <li>(1) The <strong class="emphasis bold">Eighth Amendment</strong> and the <strong class="emphasis bold">due process clause</strong> in the Fourteenth Amendment are relevant. (2) The proposed statute is most likely <strong class="emphasis bold">unconstitutional</strong>. (3) The proposed statute appears to be inhumane and excessive for the crime, which makes it cruel and unusual punishment.</li>
