The Model Penal Code defines solicitation as follows: “[a] person is guilty of solicitation to commit a crime if with the purpose of promoting or facilitating its commission he commands, encourages or requests another person to engage in specific conduct which would constitute such crime” (Model Penal Code § 5.02(1)). However, the Model Penal Code does not require direct <em class="emphasis">communication</em>, if “conduct was designed to effect such communication.” (Model Penal Code § 5.02(2)).</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="storm_1.0-ch08_s03_s01_s01_p01">Jimmy calls his friend Choo, who is reputed to be a “fence,” and asks Choo to help him sell some stolen designer shoes. If Jimmy is in a jurisdiction that criminalizes the “request” to commit <em class="emphasis">any crime</em>, Jimmy probably has committed the criminal act element required for solicitation. If Jimmy is in a jurisdiction that only criminalizes solicitation to commit a <em class="emphasis">capital felony</em> or <em class="emphasis">first-degree felony</em>, then Jimmy probably has not committed the criminal act element required for solicitation because selling stolen property is not generally graded that severely. If Jimmy is in a jurisdiction that follows the Model Penal Code, and Jimmy and Choo had a long-standing arrangement whereby Jimmy puts stolen items in a storage facility so that Choo can sell them, Jimmy will not have to communicate his request to Choo. He simply will have to place the shoes in the storage facility to commit the criminal act element required for solicitation.</p>

                <li>Solicitation is an inchoate crime because the crime that is solicited may not be completed.</li>
                <li>The criminal act element required for solicitation is words or conduct that induces another to commit any crime, a capital felony, or first-degree felony.</li>
                <li>The criminal intent element required for solicitation is specific intent or purposely to induce another to commit any crime, a capital felony, or first-degree felony.</li>
                <li>Renunciation is an affirmative defense to solicitation if the defendant voluntarily and completely renounces his or her criminal purpose and thwarts the commission of the solicited crime.</li>
                <li>Jurisdictions vary in their approach to grading solicitation. Some jurisdictions grade solicitation on a sliding scale according to the crime solicited, some grade solicitation the same as the crime solicited, and some grade solicitation as a misdemeanor, regardless of the crime solicited.</li>

                <li>Nancy asks Jennifer to help her counterfeit twenty-dollar bills. Jennifer refuses. Has a crime been committed in this situation?</li>
                <li>Read <em class="emphasis">Planter v. State</em>, 9 S.W. 3d 156 (1999). In <em class="emphasis">Planter</em>, the defendant told a former police officer wearing a wire that he would kill his estranged son-in-law for ten thousand dollars. The defendant was convicted of solicitation to commit murder. The defendant appealed on the basis that he did not solicit the former police officer to commit murder; he solicited the former police officer to <em class="emphasis">pay him</em> to commit murder. Did the Court of Criminal Appeals of Texas uphold the defendant’s conviction? The case is available at this link: <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://caselaw.findlaw.com/tx-court-of-criminal-appeals/1007515.html">http://caselaw.findlaw.com/tx-court-of-criminal-appeals/1007515.html</a>.</li>
                <li>Read <em class="emphasis">People v. Dennis</em>, 340 N.W.2d 81 (1983). In <em class="emphasis">Dennis</em>, the defendant was convicted of incitement to murder, which is the Michigan equivalent of solicitation to murder. The defendant appealed based on the fact that she solicited a police officer posing as a hit man, so the police officer did not have the intent to murder, and thus the murder was not possible. Did the Michigan Court of Appeals uphold the defendant’s conviction?
