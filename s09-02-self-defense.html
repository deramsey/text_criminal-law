An individual does not have to actually die for the force to be considered deadly. Examples of deadly force are the use of a knife, gun, vehicle, or even bare hands when there is a disparity in size between two individuals.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="storm_1.0-ch05_s02_p03">Self-defense can operate as a <strong class="emphasis bold">perfect</strong> or <strong class="emphasis bold">imperfect</strong> defense, depending on the circumstances. Defendants who commit criminal homicide justified by self-defense can be acquitted, or have a murder charge reduced from first to second or third degree, or have a charge reduced from murder to manslaughter. Criminal homicide is discussed in detail in <a class="xref" href="storm_1.0-ch09#storm_1.0-ch09">Chapter 9 "Criminal Homicide"</a>.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="storm_1.0-ch05_s02_p04">To successfully claim self-defense, the defendant must prove four elements. First, with exceptions, the defendant must prove that he or she was confronted with an <strong class="emphasis bold">unprovoked</strong> attack. Second, the defendant must prove that the threat of injury or death was <strong class="emphasis bold">imminent</strong>. Third, the defendant must prove that the <strong class="emphasis bold">degree of force</strong> used in self-defense was objectively reasonable under the circumstances. Fourth, the defendant must prove that he or she had an <strong class="emphasis bold">objectively reasonable fear</strong> that he or she was going to be injured or killed unless he or she used self-defense. The Model Penal Code defines self-defense in § 3.04(1) as “justifiable when the actor believes that such force is immediately necessary for the purpose of protecting himself against the use of unlawful force by such other person on the present occasion.”</p>

Paige chases Patty into the garage. Patty says, “Please, please don’t hurt me. I’m sorry I slapped you.” Paige kicks Patty in the back. Patty turns around and karate chops Paige in the neck, rendering her unconscious. In many jurisdictions, Patty’s karate chop is lawful under a theory of self-defense because she completely <em class="emphasis">withdrew</em> from the attack.

            <p class="para editable block" id="storm_1.0-ch05_s02_s04_s01_p01">Justin, who weighs over two hundred pounds and is six feet tall, accidentally bumps into Wanda, a slender ten-year-old child. Wanda spins around and shakes her fist at Justin. Justin responds by shoving Wanda so hard that she crashes into a telephone pole and is killed. Justin probably <em class="emphasis">cannot</em> claim self-defense under these circumstances. A reasonable person would not believe Wanda is about to seriously injure or kill Justin. Thus Justin’s response is unnecessary and unjustified in this case.</p>

Imagine that a slender, female ten-year-old severely abused Justin when he was younger. Since the abusive incident, Justin has an unreasonable fear of female children and honestly believes that they can and will hurt him if provoked. If the trier of fact determines that Justin honestly but unreasonably believed that Wanda was about to inflict serious bodily injury or kill him, any charge of murder could be reduced to manslaughter on a theory of <strong class="emphasis bold">imperfect self-defense</strong>.</p>

                <ul class="itemizedlist" id="storm_1.0-ch05_s02_s04_s02_l01">
                    <li>Self-defense is a defense based on justification that allows a defendant to use physical force to protect himself or herself from injury or death.</li>
                    <li>Deadly force is any force that can produce death. An individual does not have to die for the force to be deemed deadly.</li>
                    <li>Four elements are required for self-defense: (1) an unprovoked attack, (2) which threatens imminent injury or death, and (3) an objectively reasonable degree of force, used in response to (4) an objectively reasonable fear of injury or death.</li>
                    <li>Two exceptions to the unprovoked attack rule are an individual’s use of excessive force in response to an initial attack and the defendant’s withdrawal from the initial attack.</li>
                    <li>The battered wife defense asserts that a woman who is a victim of spousal abuse may use force in self-defense under certain circumstances, even when the threat of harm is not immediate. The battered wife defense is justified with respect to the imminence requirement: because the abuse is so constant, the battered wife faces an imminent threat every day.</li>
                    <li>Deadly force is appropriate in self-defense when the attacker threatens death, serious bodily injury, and, in some jurisdictions, a serious felony.</li>
                    <li>The duty to retreat doctrine is a common-law rule requiring a defendant to retreat if it is safe to do so, instead of using deadly force in self-defense. The stand-your-ground doctrine is a rule allowing the defendant to use deadly force if appropriate in self-defense, rather than retreating.</li>
                    <li>Imperfect self-defense is a defense available when the defendant has an honest but unreasonable belief that force is necessary to defend against injury or death. Imperfect self-defense reduces the severity of the offense, but does not result in acquittal.</li>
                </ul>

                <p class="simpara">Were They Entitled to a Jury Instruction on Imperfect Self-Defense?</p>
                <p class="para" id="storm_1.0-ch05_s02_s04_s02_p03">Read <em class="emphasis">Menendez v. Terhune</em>, 422 F.3d 1012 (2005).

                <p class="para" id="storm_1.0-ch05_s02_s04_s02_p04">Lyle and Eric Menendez were tried and convicted of murder and conspiracy to commit murder of their parents. There were two series of trials. The first trial, which had two separate juries, resulted in two hung juries. At the first trial, the brothers introduced evidence of sexual abuse by their father, and the court instructed the jury on <strong class="emphasis bold">imperfect self-defense</strong>. The imperfect self-defense jury instruction was based on the brothers’ <em class="emphasis">honest but unreasonable fear</em> that their father would hurt or kill them.<span class="footnote" id="storm_1.0-fn05_013"><em class="emphasis">Menendez v. Terhune</em>, 422 F.3d 1012, 1024 (2005), accessed November 19, 2010, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://cases.justia.com/us-court-of-appeals/F3/422/1012/569492">http://cases.justia.com/us-court-of-appeals/F3/422/1012/569492</a>.</span> The second trial took place in front of one jury and resulted in the convictions. During the second trial, some evidence of abuse was excluded, Lyle Menendez refused to testify, and there was <em class="emphasis">no</em> jury instruction on <strong class="emphasis bold">imperfect self-defense</strong>. After sentencing, the brothers petitioned for a writ of habeas corpus based on several claims, including the exclusion of the abuse evidence and failure to instruct the jury on imperfect self-defense.<span class="footnote" id="storm_1.0-fn05_014"><em class="emphasis">Menendez v.

The court held that the evidence confirmed there was no <em class="emphasis">imminent</em> threat of serious bodily injury or death when the brothers killed their parents.</p>
                <p class="para" id="storm_1.0-ch05_s02_s04_s02_p05">The facts of the case are lurid. Evidence included the sexual abuse of both boys by their father, surreptitiously taped psychotherapy sessions, spending sprees, fabricated mafia hit stories, and alleged will tampering by the brothers after the parents were killed.</p>
