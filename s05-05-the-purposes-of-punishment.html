        <h2 class="title editable block">Specific and General Deterrence</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="storm_1.0-ch01_s05_s01_p01">Deterrence prevents future crime by frightening the <em class="emphasis">defendant</em> or the <em class="emphasis">public</em>. The two types of deterrence are <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">specific</a><span class="glossdef">Prevents crime by frightening an individual defendant.</span></span> and <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">general deterrence</a><span class="glossdef">Prevents crime by frightening society with an individual defendant’s punishment.</span></span>. Specific deterrence applies to an <em class="emphasis">individual defendant</em>. When the government punishes an individual defendant, he or she is theoretically less likely to commit another crime because of fear of another similar or worse punishment. General deterrence applies to the <em class="emphasis">public</em> at large. When the public learns of an individual defendant’s punishment, the public is theoretically less likely to commit a crime because of fear of the punishment the defendant experienced. When the public learns, for example, that an individual defendant was severely punished by a sentence of life in prison or the death penalty, this knowledge can inspire a deep fear of criminal prosecution.</p>

Examples of rehabilitation include educational and vocational programs, treatment center placement, and counseling. The court can combine rehabilitation with incarceration or with probation or parole. In some states, for example, nonviolent drug offenders must participate in rehabilitation in combination with probation, rather than submitting to incarceration.<span class="footnote" id="storm_1.0-fn01_010">Ariz.
