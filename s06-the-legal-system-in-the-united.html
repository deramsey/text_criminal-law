Federalism, as set forth in the US Constitution, divides governmental power between the <em class="emphasis">federal government</em> and each of the <em class="emphasis">states</em>. This prevents a concentrated source of governmental power in one individual or small group of individuals. Because of federalism, the United States has one federal legal system, and each state has its own state legal system. Thus in the United States, a plethora of legal systems all operate harmoniously at the same time.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">The Scope of Federal Law</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="storm_1.0-ch02_s01_s01_p01">The government’s power to regulate comes from the US Constitution. The <em class="emphasis">federal</em> government derives its authority to create law from Article I, § 8, which discusses federal Congress’s <em class="emphasis">exclusive</em> or <strong class="emphasis bold">delegated powers</strong>. These include the power to regulate currency and coin, establish a post office, promote science and art by regulating the rights to discoveries and writings, declare war and raise armies, conduct foreign affairs, regulate interstate and foreign commerce, and make laws necessary and proper to execute other powers expressly granted in the Constitution. Courts have interpreted the last two powers mentioned in the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">commerce clause</a><span class="glossdef">A clause in the Constitution that allows Congress to regulate commerce (economic activity) that crosses state lines.</span></span> and the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">necessary and proper clause</a><span class="glossdef">A clause in the Constitution that allows Congress to make laws necessary to carry out all powers listed in the Constitution.</span></span> to be the <em class="emphasis">broadest</em> sources of federal regulatory authority.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="storm_1.0-ch02_s01_s01_p02">To simplify and summarize precedent defining federal regulatory authority, federal laws are meant to regulate in two areas. First, federal laws regulate issues that concern the <em class="emphasis">country</em>, rather than just one city, county, or state. The federal government regulates in the area of foreign affairs, for example, because this affects the United States of America, not just one particular region. Second, federal laws regulate commerce, which is economic activity, that <em class="emphasis">crosses from state to state</em>. Some common examples are television broadcasts, the Internet, and any form of transportation such as the airlines.</p>

The only <em class="emphasis">crimes</em> Congress is specifically authorized to punish are piracies and felonies on the high seas, counterfeiting, and treason; however, case precedent has expanded the federal government’s power to enact criminal laws based on the commerce clause and the necessary and proper clause.<span class="footnote" id="storm_1.0-fn02_001"><em class="emphasis">McCulloch v.

In general, federal criminal laws target conduct that occurs on federal property or conduct involving federal employees, currency, coin, treason, national security, rights secured by the Constitution, or commerce that crosses state lines. Currently, over five hundred crimes are listed in Part I, Title 18 of the United States Code, which codifies criminal laws for the federal government.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">The Scope of State Law</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="storm_1.0-ch02_s01_s02_p01">The US Constitution designates the states as the <em class="emphasis">primary regulatory authority</em>. This is clarified in the Tenth Amendment, which reads, “The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited to it by the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or the people.” State laws are also supposed to regulate in two areas. First, state laws regulate issues of a <em class="emphasis">local</em> character or concern. A state may regulate, for example, its water ownership and use because water can be scarce and is not generally provided to other states. Second, state laws regulate issues or things that remain within a state’s border. A state generally regulates, for example, the operation of a small business whose products are only sold locally and not shipped out of the state.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="storm_1.0-ch02_s01_s02_p02">Federal laws are <em class="emphasis">the same</em> in every state, but state laws <em class="emphasis">differ</em> from state to state. Something that is legal in one state may be illegal in another state. This inconsistency makes our system of federalism complicated for students (and lawyers). However, with a country as large and varied as the United States, it is sensible to allow each state to choose for itself which laws will be most suitable.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="storm_1.0-ch02_s01_s02_s01_p01">The power to enact criminal laws belongs almost <em class="emphasis">exclusively</em> to the states. This is because of the Tenth Amendment, which vests in states a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">police power</a><span class="glossdef">The states’ power to regulate for citizens’ health, safety, and welfare, as set forth in the Tenth Amendment to the Constitution.</span></span> to provide for the health, safety, and welfare of state citizens. Approximately 90 percent of all criminal laws are state, rather than federal. Often, federal crimes are also state crimes and can be prosecuted and punished by both the state and federal government without violating the principle of double jeopardy.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="storm_1.0-ch02_s02_p01">The federal Constitution was written to ensure that government power is distributed and never concentrated in one or more areas. This philosophy is served by <strong class="emphasis bold">federalism</strong>, where the federal government shares power with the states. It is also further served by dividing the government into three branches, all responsible for different government duties and all <em class="emphasis">checking and balancing</em> each other. The three branches of government are detailed in Articles I–III of the federal Constitution and are the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">legislative branch</a><span class="glossdef">The branch of government responsible for creating statutory law.</span></span>, the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">executive branch</a><span class="glossdef">The branch of government responsible for enforcing statutory law.</span></span>, and the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">judicial branch</a><span class="glossdef">The branch of government responsible for interpreting statutory and constitutional law(s).</span></span>. While the federal Constitution identifies only the federal branches of government, the principle of checks and balances applies to the states as well. Most states identify the three state branches of government in their state constitution.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="storm_1.0-ch02_s02_p02">Each branch of government has a distinct authority. When one branch encroaches on the duties of another, this is called a violation of <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">separation of powers</a><span class="glossdef">Each government branch must act only within the scope set forth in the Constitution.</span></span>. The <em class="emphasis">courts</em> decide whether a government branch has overstepped its boundaries because courts interpret the Constitution, which describes each branch’s sphere of influence. Thus the judicial branch, which consists of all the courts, retains the balance of power.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">The Legislative Branch</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="storm_1.0-ch02_s02_s01_p01">The <strong class="emphasis bold">legislative branch</strong> is responsible for creating statutory laws. Citizens of a state can vote for some state statutes by ballot, but the <strong class="emphasis bold">federal legislative branch</strong> enacts all federal statutes. In the federal government, the legislative branch is headed by Congress. States’ legislative branches are headed by a state legislature. Congress is <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">bicameral</a><span class="glossdef">Made up of two houses.</span></span>, which means it is made up of two houses. This system provides equal representation among the several states and by citizens of the United States. States are represented by the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Senate</a><span class="glossdef">The house of Congress responsible for representing each state.</span></span>. Every state, no matter how large or small, gets two senators. Citizens are represented by the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">House of Representatives</a><span class="glossdef">The house of Congress responsible for representing each citizen of the United States.</span></span>. Membership in the House of Representatives is based on population. A heavily populated state, like California, has more representatives than a sparsely populated state, like Alaska. States’ legislatures are generally bicameral and have a similar structure to the federal system.</p>

It allows the judicial branch to invalidate any unconstitutional law in the statutory source of law and also to change the federal and state constitutions by interpretation. For example, when a court creates an exception to an amendment to the constitution, it has made an informal change without the necessity of a national or state consensus. The federal judicial branch is headed by the US Supreme Court. Each state’s judicial branch is headed by the highest-level state appellate court. Members of the judicial branch include all judges and justices of every federal and state court in the court system, which is discussed shortly.</p>

Courts that have appellate jurisdiction review the <strong class="emphasis bold">trial record</strong> for error. The trial record includes a court reporter’s <strong class="emphasis bold">transcript</strong>, which is typed notes of the words spoken during the trial and pretrial hearings. In general, with exceptions, appellate courts cannot review a trial record until the trial has ended with a <em class="emphasis">final judgment</em>. Once the appellate court has made its review, it has the ability to take three actions. If it finds no compelling or prejudicial errors, it can <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">affirm</a><span class="glossdef">An appellate court’s power to uphold a lower court decision.</span></span> the judgment of the trial court, which means that the judgment remains the same. If it finds a significant error, it can <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">reverse</a><span class="glossdef">An appellate court’s power to change a lower court decision.</span></span> the judgment of the trial court, which means that the judgment becomes the opposite (the winner loses, the loser wins). It can also <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">remand</a><span class="glossdef">An appellate court’s power to send a case back to the trial court, with instructions.</span></span>, which means send the case back to the trial court, with instructions.

        <p class="para editable block" id="storm_1.0-ch02_s03_s01_p04">Some courts have only original jurisdiction, but most courts have a little of original and appellate jurisdiction. The US Supreme Court, for example, is primarily an appellate court with appellate jurisdiction. However, it also has original jurisdiction in some cases, as stated in the Constitution, Article III, § 2, clause 2: “In all Cases affecting Ambassadors, other public Ministers and Consuls, and those in which a State shall be Party, the supreme Court shall have original Jurisdiction. In all the other Cases before mentioned, the supreme Court shall have appellate jurisdiction.”</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="storm_1.0-ch02_s03_s01_s01_p01">Paulina is prosecuted for the attempted murder of Ariana. Paulina is represented by public defender Pedro. At Paulina’s trial, in spite of Pedro’s objections, the judge rules that Paulina’s polygraph examination results are admissible, but prohibits the admission of certain witness testimony. Paulina is found guilty and appeals, based on the judge’s evidentiary rulings. While Pedro is writing the appellate brief, he discovers case precedent barring the admission of polygraph examination results. Pedro <em class="emphasis">can include</em> the case precedent in his appellate brief but <em class="emphasis">not the prohibited witness testimony</em>. The appellate court has the jurisdiction to hold that the objection was improperly overruled by the trial court, but is limited to reviewing the trial record for error. The appellate court <em class="emphasis">lacks</em> the jurisdiction to admit new evidence not included in the trial record.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">The Federal Courts</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="storm_1.0-ch02_s03_s02_p01">For the purpose of this book, the focus is the federal trial court and the intermediate and highest level appellate courts because these courts are most frequently encountered in a criminal prosecution. Other federal specialty courts do exist but are not discussed, such as bankruptcy court, tax court, and the court of military appeals.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="storm_1.0-ch02_s03_s02_p02">The federal trial court is called the <strong class="emphasis bold">United States District Court</strong>. Large states like California have more than one district court, while smaller states may have only one. District courts hear all the federal trials, including civil and criminal trials. As stated previously, a dispute that involves only state law, or a state criminal trial, cannot proceed in district court. The exception to this rule is the diversity of citizenship exception for civil lawsuits.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="storm_1.0-ch02_s03_s02_p03">After a trial in district court, the loser gets one <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">appeal of right</a><span class="glossdef">A party is guaranteed an appeal if grounds are present.</span></span>. This means that the intermediate appellate federal court <em class="emphasis">must</em> hear an appeal of the district court trial if there are sufficient grounds. The intermediate appellate court in the federal system is the <strong class="emphasis bold">United States Court of Appeals</strong>. There is less federal law than state law, so only thirteen US Courts of Appeals exist for all fifty states. The US Courts of Appeals are spread out over thirteen judicial circuits and are also referred to as Circuit Courts.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="storm_1.0-ch02_s03_s02_p04">Circuit Courts have appellate jurisdiction and can review the district court criminal and civil trials for error. The Circuit Court reviews only trials that are federal in nature, with the exception of civil lawsuits brought to the district court under diversity of citizenship. As noted in <a class="xref" href="storm_1.0-ch01#storm_1.0-ch01">Chapter 1 "Introduction to Criminal Law"</a>, the federal Constitution governs criminal trials, so <em class="emphasis">only a guilty defendant</em> can appeal. In general, with exceptions, appeal of a not-guilty verdict (also called an <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">acquittal</a><span class="glossdef">A not-guilty verdict.</span></span>) violates a defendant’s double jeopardy protection.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="storm_1.0-ch02_s03_s02_p05">After a Circuit Court appeal, the loser has one more opportunity to appeal to the highest-level federal appellate court, which is the <strong class="emphasis bold">United States Supreme Court</strong>. The US Supreme Court is the highest court in the country and is located in Washington, DC, the nation’s capital. The US Supreme Court has eight associate justices and one chief justice: all serve a lifetime appointment.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="storm_1.0-ch02_s03_s02_p06">The US Supreme Court is a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">discretionary court</a><span class="glossdef">A court that can accept or reject appeals.</span></span>, meaning it does not have to hear appeals. Unlike the Circuit Courts, the US Supreme Court can pick and choose which appeals it wants to review. The method of applying for review with the US Supreme Court is called filing a petition for a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">writ of certiorari</a><span class="glossdef">A petition that must be granted to reach the United States Supreme Court.</span></span>.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="storm_1.0-ch02_s03_s02_p07">Any case from a Circuit Court, or a case <em class="emphasis">with a federal matter at issue</em> from a state’s highest-level appellate court, can petition for a writ of certiorari. If the writ is granted, the US Supreme Court reviews the appeal. If the writ is denied, which it is the majority of the time, the ruling of the Circuit Court or state high court is the final ruling. For this reason, the US Supreme Court reverses many cases that are accepted for review. If the US Supreme Court wants to “affirm” the intermediate appellate court ruling, all it has to do is deny the petition and let the lower court ruling stand.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">The State Courts</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="storm_1.0-ch02_s03_s03_p01">For the purpose of this book, a representative state court system is reviewed. Slight variations in this system may occur from state to state.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="storm_1.0-ch02_s03_s03_p02">Most states offer their citizens a “people’s court,” typically called small claims court. <strong class="emphasis bold">Small claims court</strong> is a civil court designed to provide state citizens with a low-cost option to resolve disputes where the amount in controversy is minimal. A traditional small claims court only has the jurisdiction to award money damages. This means that it cannot adjudicate criminal matters or family court matters such as granting a petition for divorce. Small claims courts also limit the amount of money damages available, typically less than $10,000.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="storm_1.0-ch02_s03_s03_p03">Small claims court has special rules that make it amenable to the average individual. Attorneys cannot represent clients in small claims court, although they certainly can represent themselves just like any other individual. Small claims court proceedings are generally informal, and usually no court reporter types what is said. Therefore, no court record exits for appeal. Small claims court <em class="emphasis">appeals</em> are the exception to the general rule and are usually new trials where evidence is accepted.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="storm_1.0-ch02_s03_s03_p04">States generally have a <strong class="emphasis bold">state trial court</strong> that can also be the appellate court for small claims court appeals. This trial court is usually called superior court, circuit court, or county court. State trial courts are generally all-purpose and hear civil litigation matters, state criminal trials, and nonlitigation cases including family law, wills and probate, foreclosures, and juvenile adjudications. States can, however, create “specialty courts” to hear special matters and free up the trial courts for basic criminal prosecutions and civil litigation trials. Some states divide their trial courts into lower and higher levels. The lower-level trial court adjudicates infractions and misdemeanors, along with civil lawsuits with a smaller amount in controversy. The higher-level trial court adjudicates felonies and civil lawsuits with a higher amount in controversy.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="storm_1.0-ch02_s03_s03_p05">The intermediate appellate court for the state court system is usually called the <strong class="emphasis bold">state court of appeals</strong>, although some smaller or low-population states may have only <em class="emphasis">one</em> appellate court called the <strong class="emphasis bold">state supreme court</strong>. The state courts of appeal provide appeals of right, meaning they <em class="emphasis">must</em> hear an appeal coming from the state’s trial court if adequate grounds are present. Appeals can be of any case adjudicated in the state trial court. In state criminal prosecutions, as stated earlier in the discussion of federal appeals, only a guilty defendant can appeal without violating the protection against double jeopardy. At the appellate level, the state court of appeal simply reviews the trial court record for error and does not have the <strong class="emphasis bold">jurisdiction</strong> to hear new trials or accept evidence.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="storm_1.0-ch02_s03_s03_p06">The highest appellate court for the state court system is usually called the state supreme court. In states that have both intermediate and high-level appellate courts, the state supreme court is a discretionary court that gets to select the appeals it hears, very similar to the US Supreme Court. The state supreme court generally grants a petition for writ of certiorari, or a <strong class="emphasis bold">petition for review</strong>, if it decides to hear a civil or criminal case coming out of the state court of appeal. If review is denied, the state court of appeal ruling is the final ruling on the case. If review is granted and the state supreme court rules on the case, the loser has one more chance to appeal, <em class="emphasis">if there is a federal matter</em>, to the US Supreme Court.</p>

                <li>State courts are usually limited to four, and only three adjudicate criminal matters. Small claims court is a “people’s court” and hears only civil matters with a low threshold of damages.

A <em class="emphasis">failure</em> to meet the burden of proof is also a common ground for appeal. In this section, you learn the burden of proof for the plaintiff, prosecution, and defendant.

        <h2 class="title editable block">Definition of the Burden of Proof</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="storm_1.0-ch02_s04_s01_p01">The burden of proof is a party’s responsibility to prove a disputed charge, allegation, or defense.<span class="footnote" id="storm_1.0-fn02_009">Yourdictionary.com, “Definition of Burden of Proof,” accessed September 26, 2010, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.yourdictionary.com/burden-of-proof">http://www.yourdictionary.com/burden-of-proof</a>.</span> The burden of proof has two components: the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">burden of production</a><span class="glossdef">The duty to present evidence to the trier of fact.</span></span> and the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">burden of persuasion</a><span class="glossdef">The duty to convince the trier of fact to a certain standard.</span></span>. The burden of production is the obligation to <em class="emphasis">present</em> evidence to the judge or jury. The burden of persuasion is the duty to <em class="emphasis">convince</em> the judge or jury to a certain standard, such as <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">beyond a reasonable doubt</a><span class="glossdef">The burden of proof in a criminal case, which must be enough compelling evidence to overcome the defendant’s presumption of innocence.</span></span>, which is defined shortly. This standard is simply a measuring point and is determined by examining the quantity and quality of the evidence presented. “Meeting the burden of proof” means that a party has introduced enough compelling evidence to reach the standard defined in the burden of persuasion.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="storm_1.0-ch02_s04_s01_p02">The plaintiff or prosecutor generally has the burden of proving the case, including every element of it. The defendant often has the burden of proving any defense. The trier of fact determines whether a party met the burden of proof at trial. The trier of fact would be a judge in a nonjury or <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">bench trial</a><span class="glossdef">A trial where the trier of fact is a judge, rather than a jury.</span></span>. In a <em class="emphasis">criminal</em> case, the trier of fact is almost always a jury because of the right to a jury trial in the Sixth Amendment. Jurors are not legal experts, so the judge explains the burden of proof in jury instructions, which are a common source of appeal.</p>
        <div class="section" id="storm_1.0-ch02_s04_s01_s01">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Burden of Proof in a Civil Case</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="storm_1.0-ch02_s04_s01_s01_p01">Burdens of proof vary, depending on the type of case being tried. The plaintiff’s burden of proof in a civil case is called <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">preponderance of evidence</a><span class="glossdef">The burden of proof for the plaintiff and defendant in a civil trial, and for some defenses in a criminal prosecution, which is enough evidence to prove that it is more likely than not that the party should prevail.</span></span>. Preponderance of evidence requires the plaintiff to introduce slightly more or slightly better evidence than the defense. This can be as low as 51 percent plaintiff to 49 percent defendant. When preponderance of evidence is the burden of proof, the judge or jury must be convinced that it is “more likely than not” that the defendant is liable for the plaintiff’s injuries. Preponderance of evidence is a fairly low standard, but the plaintiff must still produce more and better evidence than the defense. If the plaintiff offers evidence of questionable quality, the judge or jury can find that the burden of proof is not met and the plaintiff loses the case.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="storm_1.0-ch02_s04_s01_s01_p02">The defendant’s burden of proof when proving a defense in a civil case is also preponderance of evidence. For example, in the O. J. Simpson civil case discussed in <a class="xref" href="storm_1.0-ch01#storm_1.0-ch01">Chapter 1 "Introduction to Criminal Law"</a>, O. J. Simpson failed to meet the burden of proving the defense of <em class="emphasis">alibi</em>. The defendant does not always have to prove a defense in a civil case. If the plaintiff does not meet the burden of proof, the defendant is victorious without having to present <em class="emphasis">any evidence at all</em>.</p>

The only key piece of evidence in Ann’s trial is the murder weapon, which was discovered in Ann’s dresser drawer during a law enforcement search. Before Ann’s trial, the defense makes a motion to suppress the murder weapon evidence because the search warrant in Ann’s case was signed by a judge who was inebriated and mentally incompetent. The defense is successful with this motion, and the judge rules that the murder weapon is <em class="emphasis">inadmissible</em> at trial. The prosecution decides to proceed anyway. If there is no other convincing and credible evidence of Ann’s guilt, Ann does not need to put on a defense in this case. The prosecution will fail to meet the burden of proof and Ann will be acquitted.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Inference and Presumption</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="storm_1.0-ch02_s04_s02_p01">Parties can use two tools to help meet the burden of proof: <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">inference</a><span class="glossdef">A conclusion the trier of fact may make.</span></span> and <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">presumption</a><span class="glossdef">A conclusion the trier of fact must make.</span></span>. Jury instructions can include inferences and presumptions and are often instrumental in the successful outcome of a case.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="storm_1.0-ch02_s04_s02_p02">An inference is a conclusion that the judge or jury <em class="emphasis">may</em> make under the circumstances. An inference is never mandatory but is a choice. For example, if the prosecution proves that the defendant punched the victim in the face after screaming, “I hate you!” the judge or jury can infer that the punch was thrown intentionally.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="storm_1.0-ch02_s04_s02_p03">A presumption is a conclusion that the judge or jury <em class="emphasis">must</em> make under the circumstances. As stated previously, all criminal defendants are presumed innocent. Thus the judge or jury <em class="emphasis">must</em> begin any criminal trial concluding that the defendant is not guilty.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="storm_1.0-ch02_s04_s02_p04">Presumptions can be <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">rebuttable</a><span class="glossdef">Can be overcome with evidence.</span></span> or <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">irrebuttable</a><span class="glossdef">Cannot be overcome with evidence.</span></span>. A party can disprove a <em class="emphasis">rebuttable</em> presumption. The prosecution can rebut the presumption of innocence with evidence proving beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant is guilty. An irrebuttable presumption is irrefutable and <em class="emphasis">cannot</em> be disproved. In some jurisdictions, it is an irrebuttable presumption that children under the age of seven are incapable of forming criminal intent. Thus in these jurisdictions children under the age of seven cannot be criminally prosecuted (although they may be subject to a juvenile adjudication proceeding).</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Circumstantial and Direct Evidence</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="storm_1.0-ch02_s04_s03_p01">Two primary classifications are used for evidence: <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">circumstantial evidence</a><span class="glossdef">A type of evidence that indirectly proves a fact.</span></span> or <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">direct evidence</a><span class="glossdef">A type of evidence that directly proves a fact.</span></span>.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="storm_1.0-ch02_s04_s03_p02">Circumstantial evidence indirectly proves a fact. Fingerprint evidence is usually circumstantial. A defendant’s fingerprint at the scene of the crime <em class="emphasis">directly</em> proves that the defendant placed a finger at that location. It <em class="emphasis">indirectly</em> proves that because the defendant was present at the scene and placed a finger there, the defendant committed the crime. Common examples of circumstantial evidence are fingerprint evidence, DNA evidence, and blood evidence. Criminal cases relying on circumstantial evidence are more difficult for the prosecution because circumstantial evidence leaves room for doubt in a judge’s or juror’s mind. However, circumstantial evidence such as DNA evidence can be very reliable and compelling, so the prosecution can and often does meet the burden of proof using <em class="emphasis">only</em> circumstantial evidence.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="storm_1.0-ch02_s04_s03_p03">Direct evidence directly proves a fact. For example, eyewitness testimony is often direct evidence. An eyewitness testifying that he or she saw the defendant commit the crime <em class="emphasis">directly</em> proves that the defendant committed the crime. Common examples of direct evidence are eyewitness testimony, a defendant’s confession, or a video or photograph of the defendant committing the crime. Criminal cases relying on direct evidence are easier to prove because there is less potential for reasonable doubt. However, direct evidence can be unreliable and is not necessarily preferable to circumstantial evidence. If an eyewitness is <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">impeached</a><span class="glossdef">When a witness is made to appear untruthful.</span></span>, which means he or she loses credibility, the witness’s testimony lacks the evidentiary value of reliable circumstantial evidence such as DNA evidence.</p>

                <li>The burden of proof is a party’s obligation to prove a charge, allegation, or defense.</li>
                <li>The burden of production is the duty to present evidence to the trier of fact. The burden of persuasion is the duty to convince the trier of fact to a certain standard, such as preponderance of evidence or beyond a reasonable doubt.</li>
                <li>
                    <p class="para">The civil burden of proof is preponderance of evidence, for both the plaintiff and the defendant. The criminal burden of proof for the prosecution is beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>
                    <ul class="itemizedlist" id="storm_1.0-ch02_s04_s03_l02">
                        <li>The criminal burden of proof for the defense is generally preponderance of evidence. States vary on whether they require the criminal defendant to meet both the burden of production and persuasion or just the burden of production. Different defenses also require different burdens of proof.</li>
                        <li>In states that require the defendant to meet only the burden of production, the prosecution must disprove the defense to a preponderance of evidence or beyond a reasonable doubt, depending on the state and on the defense.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>An inference is a conclusion the trier of fact may make, if it chooses to. A presumption is a conclusion the trier of fact must make. A rebuttable presumption can be disproved; an irrebuttable presumption cannot.</li>
                <li>Circumstantial evidence indirectly proves a fact. A fingerprint at the scene of the crime, for example, indirectly proves that because the defendant was present at the scene, the defendant committed the crime. Direct evidence directly proves a fact. If the defendant confesses to a crime, for example, this is direct evidence that the defendant committed the crime.</li>

        <h3 class="title">Summary</h3>
        <p class="para" id="storm_1.0-ch02_s05_p01">The United States’ system of government is called federalism and consists of one federal government regulating issues of a national concern and separate state governments regulating local issues. The bulk of criminal lawmaking resides with the states because of the police power granted to the states in the Tenth Amendment. Ninety percent of all criminal laws are state laws. Many federal crimes are also state crimes, and a defendant can be prosecuted federally and by a state without triggering double jeopardy protection. If a federal statute exists on an issue, a state statute cannot conflict with it because of the Constitution’s Supremacy Clause.</p>
        <p class="para" id="storm_1.0-ch02_s05_p02">The Constitution sets forth three branches of government. The legislative branch consists of Congress and has the authority to create laws. The executive branch is headed by the president of the United States and has the authority to enforce the laws created by the legislative branch. The judicial branch is headed by the US Supreme Court and has the authority to interpret laws and the Constitution. Each branch checks and balances each other, and the judicial branch ensures that no branch oversteps its authority and violates separation of powers. State governments mimic the federal branches of government at the state level and set forth authorities in each state’s constitution.</p>
        <p class="para" id="storm_1.0-ch02_s05_p03">The federal court system exclusively adjudicates federal matters and consists primarily of the US District Court, the US Court of Appeals or Circuit Court, and the US Supreme Court. Each state has its own court system consisting primarily of a trial court, intermediate court of appeal, and possibly a high court of appeal. Trial courts have original jurisdiction and can accept evidence. Appellate courts have appellate jurisdiction and are limited to reviewing the trial courts’ decisions for error.</p>
        <p class="para" id="storm_1.0-ch02_s05_p04">Each party in a civil or criminal trial must meet a burden of proof, which consists of a burden of producing evidence and a burden of persuading the trier of fact. The burden of proof for a civil plaintiff or defendant is preponderance of evidence, which means that the trier of fact must be convinced it is more likely than not that a party should prevail. The burden of proof for the prosecution in a criminal case is beyond a reasonable doubt, which is a stricter standard than preponderance of evidence and consists of enough compelling evidence to rebut the defendant’s presumption of innocence. The burden of proof for a criminal defense varies but is often preponderance of evidence. Inferences, which are conclusions the trier of fact may make, and presumptions, which are conclusions the trier of fact must make, can help meet the burden of proof. The evidence presented to meet the burden of proof can be circumstantial, which indirectly proves a fact, or direct, which directly proves a fact. Circumstantial evidence leaves room for reasonable doubt, but it can be reliable and the basis of a successful criminal prosecution.</p>

            <li>Congress gets the authority to criminalize conduct involving the Internet from the commerce clause because the Internet includes economic activity and <em class="emphasis">crosses state lines</em>. Both the federal and state government can prosecute the defendant under federal and state criminal statutes for one act without violating double jeopardy.</li>
            <li>The US Supreme Court relied on the commerce clause and the Fourteenth Amendment. Specifically, the Court ruled that gender-motivated crimes of violence are not <em class="emphasis">economic activity</em> and do not have a <em class="emphasis">national</em> effect, so the commerce clause does not support federal legislation in this area. Furthermore, the Court held that the Fourteenth Amendment due process clause is targeted at state government action, not <em class="emphasis">individual</em> defendants, so it is likewise inapplicable.</li>
            <li>The US Supreme Court held that the Pennsylvania Sedition Act is <em class="emphasis">superseded</em> by the Smith Act, 18 U.S.C. § 2385. Specifically, the Court referenced the supremacy of federal law on the same topic, thereby preempting the state statute.</li>

            <li>The mayor is violating separation of powers because members of the executive branch cannot invalidate or supersede laws passed by the legislative branch; only the <em class="emphasis">judicial</em> branch is entitled to do this via <em class="emphasis">judicial review</em>. The judicial branch should check and balance this action, <em class="emphasis">if</em> someone attacks the mayor’s policy in court.</li>
            <li>The US Supreme Court did not uphold President Truman’s action and ruled that he was violating <em class="emphasis">separation of powers</em>. A statute on point already disallowed the president’s action (the Taft-Hartley Act). The president cannot supersede Congress’s authority by ignoring a constitutional statute that Congress enacted, even during wartime.</li>
            <li>The US Supreme Court reversed the US Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit. The Court held that the judicial branch is not required to allow unconstitutional federal statutes to remain in effect during wartime because of <em class="emphasis">separation of powers</em>. The Court determined that the detainee’s constitutional right to due process allowed him access to an attorney and a court trial, in spite of the federal statute.</li>

            <li>Jenna cannot appeal to the US Supreme Court because she does not appear to have a <em class="emphasis">federal</em> issue. Parties can appeal from a state’s highest level appellate court directly into the US Supreme Court, but the US Supreme Court is a federal court and only has the jurisdiction to hear federal matters. Jenna cannot meet the criteria of diversity jurisdiction or diversity of citizenship because even if she and Max are citizens of different states, the amount in controversy is too low (it needs to be at least $75,000).</li>
            <li>The US Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit held that there <em class="emphasis">was jurisdiction</em>, in spite of the absence of a trial. The court also held that the extraordinary circumstances compelled a reversal of the district court order denying a motion to dismiss the defendants’ indictment. The court essentially ruled that the defendants had a right not to be tried.</li>
            <li>The US Supreme Court held that a corporation is a citizen of its state of incorporation <em class="emphasis">and</em> the state in which its <em class="emphasis">principal place of business</em> is located. The principal place of business is the “nerve center state,” which is the state that houses the corporate headquarters.</li>

            <li>Bria will not be successful with the insanity defense because she cannot meet the burden of proof, which is <strong class="emphasis bold">preponderance of evidence</strong>. Preponderance of evidence is a fairly low standard, but Bria must still convince the trier of fact that it is more likely than not she is insane. She cannot do this with her testimony, standing alone. Clearly, Bria has an important <em class="emphasis">self-interest</em> in eliminating her criminal responsibility in this case. Thus her <em class="emphasis">subjective</em> testimony regarding her own mental state is not compelling enough to meet the 51 percent to 49 percent standard.</li>
            <li>The US Supreme Court held that it is <em class="emphasis">constitutional</em> to put the burden of proving extreme emotional disturbance on the defendant, reducing murder to manslaughter. The Court held that this did not relieve the prosecution of the burden of proving every element of murder beyond a reasonable doubt and thus was in compliance with the <strong class="emphasis bold">due process clause</strong> of the Constitution.</li>
            <li>The US Supreme Court held that a constitutionally deficient jury instruction on the definition of beyond a reasonable doubt was a <em class="emphasis">prejudicial error</em> and required a reversal of the defendant’s conviction for murder. The Court determined that the improper jury instruction deprived the defendant of his Sixth Amendment right to a jury trial.</li>

            <li>The federal judge Susan Bolton based her decision on <em class="emphasis">federal preemption</em> and an <em class="emphasis">impermissible state burden</em> on legal resident aliens.

            <li>The Indiana Court of Appeals held that there was <strong class="emphasis bold">sufficient</strong> evidence to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant knew the serial numbers on the gun had been altered. The appearance of the gun and the defendant’s week-long possession were enough for a reasonable juror to infer knowledge.</li>
            <li>The US Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit held that there was <strong class="emphasis bold">insufficient</strong> evidence to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant knew the victim was a peace officer. The court held that a reasonable juror could not infer knowledge from the whip antennae and the victim’s job at Angola prison.</li>
            <li>The Supreme Court of Oregon held that there was <strong class="emphasis bold">sufficient</strong> evidence to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant threatened immediate use of physical force. The court held that the defendant’s appearance, combined with the lateness of the hour and the demands for money, could be an implicit threat under the circumstances.</li>
            <li>The District Court of Appeal of Florida held that there was <strong class="emphasis bold">sufficient</strong> evidence to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant possessed cocaine with the intent to sell. The court pointed out that the criminal statute at issue did not require a specified quantity of cocaine. The court also reasoned that a jury could infer from the packaging and expert testimony that the other packages also contained cocaine.</li>
