    <p class="para editable block" id="storm_1.0-ch03_s01_p01">In addition to statutory and common-law defenses, a criminal defendant has extensive protections that are set forth in the United States Constitution. As stated earlier in this book, the federal Constitution is applicable in all criminal cases because the government is prosecuting. State constitutions typically mirror the federal Constitution because it sets the <em class="emphasis">minimum</em> standard of protection that is guaranteed to all citizens. States can and often do provide <em class="emphasis">more</em> constitutional protections to criminal defendants than the federal Constitution, as long as those state protections do not violate notions of federal supremacy. In this chapter, the federal Constitution is analyzed with reference to state constitutional protections when relevant.</p>
    <div class="section" id="storm_1.0-ch03_s01_s01">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Constitutional Protections</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="storm_1.0-ch03_s01_s01_p01">Generally, two types of constitutional protections exist. First, a defendant can challenge the constitutionality of a criminal statute or ordinance (from this point forward, the term <em class="emphasis">statute</em> includes ordinances unless otherwise noted). Recall from <a class="xref" href="storm_1.0-ch01#storm_1.0-ch01">Chapter 1 "Introduction to Criminal Law"</a> that these codified laws cannot conflict with or attempt to supersede the Constitution. An attack on the constitutionality of a statute can be a claim that the statute is <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">unconstitutional on its face</a><span class="glossdef">The wording of a statute is unconstitutional.</span></span>, is <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">unconstitutional as applied</a><span class="glossdef">The enforcement of a statute is unconstitutional.</span></span>, or <em class="emphasis">both</em>. A statute is unconstitutional on its face when its wording is unconstitutional. A statute is unconstitutional as applied when its enforcement is unconstitutional. The difference between the two is significant. If a statute is unconstitutional on its face, it is invalid under <em class="emphasis">any circumstances</em>. If the statute is unconstitutional as applied, it is only unconstitutional under certain circumstances.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="storm_1.0-ch03_s01_s01_p02">A second type of constitutional protection is <em class="emphasis">procedural</em>. The defendant can protest an unconstitutional procedure that occurs during prosecution. Procedure during prosecution includes, but is not limited to, arrest, interrogation, search, filing of charges, trial, and appeal. The defendant can make a motion to dismiss the charges, suppress evidence, or declare a mistrial. The defendant can also appeal and seek to reverse a conviction, among other remedies.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="storm_1.0-ch03_s01_s01_p03">This book concentrates on criminal law rather than criminal procedure, so the bulk of this chapter is devoted to unconstitutional criminal statutes, rather than unconstitutional <em class="emphasis">procedures</em>. The exception is the right to a jury trial, which is discussed shortly.</p>
        <div class="section" id="storm_1.0-ch03_s01_s01_s01">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Example of Constitutional Protections</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="storm_1.0-ch03_s01_s01_s01_p01">Bill is on trial for obstructing a public sidewalk. Bill was arrested for standing in front of a restaurant’s entrance with a sign stating “will eat any and all leftovers.” The city ordinance Bill violated makes it a misdemeanor to “stand or sit on a public sidewalk with a sign.” To save money, the judge presiding over Bill’s trial declares that Bill will have a bench trial, rather than a jury trial. In this example, Bill can constitutionally attack the city <em class="emphasis">ordinance</em> for violating his freedom of speech because it prohibits holding a sign. The city ordinance appears unconstitutional <em class="emphasis">on its face</em> and <em class="emphasis">as applied</em> to Bill. Bill can also constitutionally attack <em class="emphasis">his bench trial</em> because he has the right to a jury trial. He could do this by making a motion to declare a mistrial, by petitioning an appellate court to halt the trial, or by appeal after a judgment of conviction.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Judicial Review</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="storm_1.0-ch03_s01_s02_p01">As stated previously in this book, courts review statutes to ensure that they conform to the Constitution pursuant to their power of <strong class="emphasis bold">judicial review</strong>. Courts generally use different standards of review when constitutional protections are at stake. Typically, a court balances the <em class="emphasis">government’s</em> interest in regulating certain conduct against an <em class="emphasis">individual’s</em> interest in a constitutionally protected right. This balancing of interests varies depending on the right at stake. If a constitutional right is fundamental, the court uses <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">strict scrutiny</a><span class="glossdef">A standard of judicial review used when a statute encroaches on a fundamental constitutional right; the statute is unconstitutional unless it is supported by a compelling government interest and uses the least restrictive means.</span></span> to analyze the statute at issue. A statute that violates or inhibits fundamental constitutional protections is presumptively invalid and can be upheld only if it uses the least restrictive means possible. The government also must prove the statute is supported by a compelling government interest. When the challenge is based on discrimination under the equal protection clause, the court may use a lower standard, called the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">rational basis test</a><span class="glossdef">A standard of judicial review occasionally used when analyzing a statute pursuant to the equal protection clause; the statute is unconstitutional unless it is rationally related to a legitimate government interest.</span></span>. The rational basis test allows a statute to discriminate if the statute is rationally related to a legitimate government interest. Most constitutional rights are considered fundamental and trigger the strict scrutiny of the courts.</p>
        <div class="section" id="storm_1.0-ch03_s01_s02_s01">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Example of Strict Scrutiny</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="storm_1.0-ch03_s01_s02_s01_p01">Review the example regarding Bill, who was arrested essentially for standing and holding a sign. The US Supreme Court has held that freedom of speech is a <em class="emphasis">fundamental right</em>. Thus a court reviewing the ordinance in Bill’s case will hold the ordinance presumptively invalid, unless the government can demonstrate a compelling interest in enacting it, and that it used the least restrictive means possible. The ordinance is broadly written to include all signs, and preventing individuals from holding signs does not serve a compelling government interest, so this difficult standard will probably result in the court holding the ordinance <em class="emphasis">unconstitutional</em>.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="storm_1.0-ch03_s01_s03_p01">The legislative branch cannot punish defendants without a trial or enact retroactive criminal statutes pursuant to the Constitution’s prohibition against <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">bill of attainder</a><span class="glossdef">A statute that punishes a defendant without a trial.</span></span> and <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">ex post facto laws</a><span class="glossdef">A criminal statute that punishes a defendant retroactively.</span></span>. Article 1, § 9, clause 3 states, in pertinent part, “No Bill of Attainder or ex post facto Law shall be passed.” The prohibition on bill of attainder and ex post facto laws is extended to the states in Article 1, § 10, clause 1: “No State shall…pass any Bill of Attainder, ex post facto Law.” Many state constitutions also prohibit ex post facto legislative action, mirroring the federal Constitution.<span class="footnote" id="storm_1.0-fn03_001">Indiana Constitution, art.

The drafters of the Constitution wanted to ensure that criminal defendants have a full and fair adjudication of their rights before the government imposes punishment. Bill of attainder is usually accomplished by a statute that targets an individual or group of individuals for some type of government sanction. Bill of attainder protection enforces <em class="emphasis">separation of powers</em> by eliminating the ability of the legislature to impose criminal punishment without a trial conducted by the judicial branch.<span class="footnote" id="storm_1.0-fn03_002"><em class="emphasis">U.S. v.

Brianne applies for a job as a teacher at her local elementary school and is refused, based on this statute: “Members of any subversive group, including the Communist party, cannot hold public office nor teach for a public institution.” Brianne could attack this statute as a bill of attainder. Its provisions, targeting members of the Communist party or any other subversive group, <em class="emphasis">punish</em> by eliminating career opportunities. The members targeted are punished without a trial or any adjudication of their rights. Thus this statute allows the legislature to impose a sanction without a trial in violation of the Constitution’s prohibited powers.</p>

There are three types of ex post facto laws. First, a law is ex post facto if it punishes behavior that occurred before the law was in effect.

Third, a law can be ex post facto if it increases the possibility of conviction after the crime occurred.</p>

Kathy and Sarah can attack the statute on its face and as applied as void for vagueness. The term “inappropriate” is unclear and can mean different things to different people.

Statutes that prohibit hate speech must be narrowly drafted to include only speech that is supported by the intent to intimidate. Statutes that prohibit obscenity must target speech that appeals to a prurient interest in sex, depicts sexual conduct in a patently offensive way, and has little or no literary, artistic, political, or scientific value. Nude dancing can be regulated as long as the regulation is reasonable, such as requiring dancers to wear pasties and a g-string.</li>

        <p class="para editable block" id="storm_1.0-ch03_s04_s01_p01">US Supreme Court precedent has held that the right to privacy comes from the First, Third, Fourth, Fifth, Ninth, and Fourteenth Amendments. The First Amendment protects the right to speak freely, assemble peacefully, and worship according to individual choice. The Third Amendment prohibits the government from forcing individuals to quarter, house, or feed soldiers. The Fourth Amendment prevents the government from unreasonably searching or seizing an individual or an individual’s property. The Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments provide due process of law before the government can deprive an individual of life, liberty, or property. The Ninth Amendment states that rights not explicitly set forth in the Constitution may still exist. Taken together, these amendments indicate that the Constitution was written to erect a barrier between individuals and an <em class="emphasis">overly intrusive</em> and <em class="emphasis">regulatory</em> government. In modern society, this right to privacy guarantees the right to use <em class="emphasis">birth control</em>, the right to an <em class="emphasis">abortion</em>, and the right to <em class="emphasis">participate in consensual sexual relations</em>.</p>

                <li>A state court order forbids the defendant from possessing a handgun while on probation. This makes it impossible for the defendant to resume his career as a police officer. How will this court order be analyzed under recent US Supreme Court precedent interpreting the Second Amendment?</li>
                <li>Read <em class="emphasis">Lewis v. U.S.</em>, 445 U.S. 55 (1980). In <em class="emphasis">Lewis</em>, the defendant, a felon, was convicted under a federal statute for possession of a firearm by a convicted felon. The defendant claimed that this was unconstitutional because he was not represented by counsel during his trial on the original felony. The defendant never sought a pardon or reversal of his conviction for the original felony on appeal. Did the US Supreme Court uphold the defendant’s conviction for possession of a firearm by a convicted felon? The case is available at this link: <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=1988023855177829800&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2&amp;as_vis=1&amp;oi=scholarr">http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=1988023855177829800&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2&amp;as_vis=1&amp;oi=scholarr</a>.</li>
                <li>Read <em class="emphasis">U.S. v. Lopez</em>, 514 U.S. 549 (1995). In <em class="emphasis">Lopez</em>, the US Supreme Court held that a federal statute prohibiting firearms near schools was unconstitutional because it regulated conduct that had no effect on interstate commerce and thus exceeded Congress’s authority under the commerce clause. If a state enacts a similar statute, would this be constitutional under the Second Amendment?

The first execution in America took place in 1608, for spying.<span class="footnote" id="storm_1.0-fn03_044">Death Penalty Information Center, “Introduction to the Death Penalty,” deathpenaltyinfo.org website, accessed October 17, 2010, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/part-i-history-death-penalty">http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/part-i-history-death-penalty</a>.</span> Methods of execution and capital crimes varied from colony to colony.

            <p class="para editable block" id="storm_1.0-ch03_s06_s01_s02_p01">A claim that capital punishment is <em class="emphasis">inhumane</em> and therefore unconstitutional under the Eighth Amendment focuses on the <em class="emphasis">method</em> of execution. Throughout the history of the death penalty, many methods of execution have been employed, including shooting, hanging, electrocution, the gas chamber, and lethal injection. At the time of this writing, the law is in a state of flux as to which methods of execution are constitutional because many state and federal decisions have stricken virtually every method available. The current focus of the courts is <em class="emphasis">lethal injection</em> because it is one of the few methods that has not been condemned as unconstitutional. Most states that authorize the death penalty use lethal injection as the primary method of execution. In a recent statement on this issue, the US Supreme Court in <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=10752510346595419167&amp;q=Baze+v.+Rees&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2,5"><em class="emphasis">Baze v.

Although the states and the federal government have designated many capital crimes that may not result in death, for example, treason that does not lead to death, the US Supreme Court has confirmed that the death penalty is too severe for most crimes.

The only crime against an individual that currently merits the death penalty is criminal homicide, which is the unlawful killing of one human being by another.

        <h2 class="title editable block">Sentencing that Violates the Right to a Jury Trial</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="storm_1.0-ch03_s06_s03_p01">Modern US Supreme Court precedent has expanded the jury’s role in sentencing pursuant to the Sixth Amendment. Although a detailed discussion of sentencing procedure is beyond the scope of this book, a brief overview of sentencing and the roles of the judge and jury is necessary to a fundamental understanding of this important trial right, as is set forth in the following section.</p>
        <div class="section" id="storm_1.0-ch03_s06_s03_s01">
            <h2 class="title editable block">The Role of the Judge and Jury in Sentencing Fact-Finding</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="storm_1.0-ch03_s06_s03_s01_p01">As stated in <a class="xref" href="storm_1.0-ch02#storm_1.0-ch02">Chapter 2 "The Legal System in the United States"</a>, the trier of fact decides the facts and renders a decision on innocence or guilt using <strong class="emphasis bold">beyond a reasonable doubt</strong> as the standard for the burden of proof. The trier of fact in a criminal prosecution is almost always a <em class="emphasis">jury</em> because of the right to a jury trial in the Sixth Amendment. Occasionally, the defendant waives the right to a jury trial and has a bench trial with a judge playing the role of trier of fact. Although the jury determines innocence or guilt during a jury trial, the verdict defines the end of their role as the trier of fact, and the <em class="emphasis">judge</em> sets the sentence. The death penalty is an exception to the jury’s limited role in sentencing; a jury must decide whether to sentence the defendant to death at a separate hearing after the trial has concluded.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="storm_1.0-ch03_s06_s03_s01_p02">Generally, criminal sentencing takes place after the trial. Although the sentencing procedure varies from state to state and from state to federal, a sentencing hearing is typically held after guilt has been determined at trial or after a guilty plea. For many years, judges have had almost <em class="emphasis">exclusive</em> control of sentencing. Although judges are restricted by the fact-finding done at trial, they can receive new evidence at sentencing if it is relevant. For example, a judge is bound by a jury determination that the defendant used a weapon when committing an armed robbery. However, the judge can accept new evidence at sentencing that reveals the defendant had two prior convictions for armed robbery and can enhance the sentence under a habitual offender or three-strikes statute.</p>

                <h2 class="title editable block">Sentencing Enhancement by Judges</h2>
                <p class="para editable block" id="storm_1.0-ch03_s06_s03_s01_s01_p01">Until recently, judges could use evidence received at the sentencing hearing to enhance a sentence beyond the statutory maximum by making a determination of the <em class="emphasis">new</em> facts to a <strong class="emphasis bold">preponderance of evidence</strong>. However, in <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=4053038751252355308&amp;q=Apprendi+v.+New+Jersey&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2,5"><em class="emphasis">Apprendi v. New Jersey</em></a>, 530 U.S. 466 (2000), the US Supreme Court held that the right to a jury trial prohibits judges from enhancing criminal sentences beyond the statutory maximum based on facts not determined by a jury <strong class="emphasis bold">beyond a reasonable doubt</strong>. In <em class="emphasis">Apprendi</em>, the trial court enhanced the defendant’s sentence beyond the statutory maximum for possession of a firearm with an unlawful purpose under New Jersey’s hate crimes statute. Although the jury did not determine that the defendant’s crime was a hate crime, the judge accepted new evidence at sentencing that indicated the defendant’s shooting into a residence was racially motivated. The US Supreme Court reversed the New Jersey Supreme Court, which upheld the sentencing procedure. The Court held that <em class="emphasis">other than evidence of a prior conviction</em>, a judge cannot enhance a defendant’s sentence beyond the statutory maximum unless there has been a factual determination by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt of the facts supporting the sentencing enhancement. The Court based its holding on the Sixth Amendment right to a jury trial as incorporated and applied to the states through the Fourteenth Amendment due process clause.</p>

                <p class="para editable block" id="storm_1.0-ch03_s06_s03_s01_s02_p01">Ross is tried and convicted by a jury of simple kidnapping. The maximum sentence for simple kidnapping is five years. At Ross’s sentencing hearing, the judge hears testimony from Ross’s kidnapping victim about the physical and mental torture Ross inflicted during the kidnapping. The victim did not testify at trial. The judge finds that the victim’s testimony is credible and rules that Ross used cruelty during the kidnapping by a <strong class="emphasis bold">preponderance of evidence</strong>. The judge thereafter enhances Ross’s sentence to eight years, based on a statutory sentencing enhancement of three years for “deliberate cruelty inflicted during the commission of a crime.” The three-year sentencing enhancement is most likely unconstitutional. Under the Sixth Amendment right to a jury trial, the jury must find deliberate cruelty <strong class="emphasis bold">beyond a reasonable doubt</strong>. A court can strike the enhancement of three years on appeal, and on remand, the trial court cannot increase the sentence beyond the five-year maximum.</p>

        <h3 class="title">Summary</h3>
        <p class="para" id="storm_1.0-ch03_s07_p01">The US Constitution protects criminal defendants from certain statutes and procedures. State constitutions usually mirror the federal and occasionally provide more protection to criminal defendants than the federal Constitution, as long as the state constitutions do not violate federal supremacy. Statutes can be unconstitutional as written or as enforced and must be supported by a sufficient government interest. Statutes that punish without a trial (bills of attainder) or criminal statutes that are applied retroactively (ex post facto) are unconstitutional under Article 1 §§ 9 and 10. Other constitutional protections are in the Bill of Rights, which is the first ten amendments, and the Fourteenth Amendment, which contains the due process clause and the equal protection clause.</p>
        <p class="para" id="storm_1.0-ch03_s07_p02">The due process clause prohibits the government from taking an individual’s life, liberty, or property arbitrarily, without notice and an opportunity to be heard. Statutes that are vague or criminalize constitutionally protected conduct (overbroad) violate due process. The Fifth Amendment due process clause applies to the federal government, and the Fourteenth Amendment due process clause applies to the states. The Fourteenth Amendment due process clause also selectively incorporates fundamental rights from the Bill of Rights and applies them to the states. Rights incorporated and applied to the states are the right to free speech, the right to privacy, the right to bear arms, the right to be free from cruel and unusual punishment, and the right to a jury trial. The Fourteenth Amendment also contains the equal protection clause, which prevents the government from enacting statutes that discriminate without a sufficient government interest.</p>
        <p class="para" id="storm_1.0-ch03_s07_p03">The First Amendment protects speech, expression, and expressive conduct from being criminalized without a compelling government interest and a statute that uses the least restrictive means possible. Some exceptions to the First Amendment are precise statutes targeting fighting words, incitement to riot, hate crimes, obscenity, and nude dancing. The First, Third, Fourth, Fifth, Ninth, and Fourteenth Amendments also create a right to privacy that prevents the government from criminalizing the use of birth control, abortion, or consensual sexual relations.</p>
        <p class="para" id="storm_1.0-ch03_s07_p04">The Second Amendment protects an individual’s right to possess a usable handgun in the home for self-defense. This right is not extended to convicted felons, the mentally ill, commercial sale of firearms, and firearm possession near schools and government buildings. The Eighth Amendment protects criminal defendants from inhumane and excessive punishments. The Sixth Amendment ensures that all facts used to extend a criminal defendant’s sentencing beyond the statutory maximum must be determined by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>

            <li>The court will probably analyze whether the statute is constitutional under the <strong class="emphasis bold">right to privacy</strong> and the <strong class="emphasis bold">equal protection clause</strong>. The right to privacy analysis will use <em class="emphasis">strict scrutiny</em> because the right to privacy is <em class="emphasis">fundamental</em>. The state must demonstrate a <em class="emphasis">compelling</em> state interest in regulating sex in prison. The state’s arguments will probably focus on maintaining integrity, safety, and security in the institution. Under the equal protection clause analysis, the state has to show a <em class="emphasis">legitimate</em> state interest pursuant to the rational basis test because the category targeted—inmates in prison—is <em class="emphasis">rational</em>, not arbitrary.</li>
            <li>The Court upheld the statute, even though this case was post-<em class="emphasis">Roe v. Wade</em>.

            <li>The <em class="emphasis">categorization</em> of some speech as outside the First Amendment’s protection generally focuses on speech that can produce immediate or imminent harm or lawless action, like <strong class="emphasis bold">fighting words</strong>, or speech that is devoid of social value, like <strong class="emphasis bold">obscenity</strong>. Depictions of animal cruelty probably fall within the second category. Whether you believe depictions of animal cruelty should be criminalized depends on whether you feel another category should be added to the list. The US Supreme Court was reluctant to expand categorization, indicating that First Amendment protections far exceed government interests in content-based regulations.</li>
            <li>Some possible consequences of expanding categorization are the increase of government censorship into areas that may have value, either literary, artistic, political, or scientific. Any time case precedent limits the First Amendment, individual rights of expression are likewise inhibited, and the government’s power to regulate and enact laws encroaching upon individual freedoms is <em class="emphasis">enhanced</em>.</li>

            <li>(1) The <strong class="emphasis bold">ex post facto clause</strong> is relevant. (2) The statute is most likely <strong class="emphasis bold">constitutional</strong>. (3) Even though the statute is retroactive, the statute is not a criminal law, but a tax increase, so there is no violation of the ex post facto clause.</li>
            <li>(1) The <strong class="emphasis bold">First Amendment</strong> and the <strong class="emphasis bold">due process clause</strong> in the Fourteenth Amendment are relevant. (2) The proposed statute is most likely <strong class="emphasis bold">unconstitutional</strong>. (3) The statute is probably void for vagueness and overbroad. The word “art” can be interpreted differently by different people, so it leads to uneven application by law enforcement. The statute also fails to give the public notice of what is criminal. In addition, because the statute criminalizes the display of “art,” it is overbroad and includes expressive works that may have artistic value and are protected under the First Amendment pursuant to the <em class="emphasis">Miller</em> test of obscenity.</li>
            <li>(1) The <strong class="emphasis bold">equal protection clause</strong> of the Fourteenth Amendment is relevant. (2) The proposed statute is most likely <strong class="emphasis bold">constitutional</strong>. (3) The statute discriminates against criminal defendants infected with the AIDS virus. However, this classification has a rational basis and is not arbitrary. The state government has an interest in preventing the spread of AIDS, so the statute will probably be upheld under the equal protection clause, even though it is discriminatory.</li>
            <li>(1) The <strong class="emphasis bold">Second Amendment</strong> and the <strong class="emphasis bold">due process clause</strong> in the Fourteenth Amendment are relevant. (2) The proposed statute is most likely <strong class="emphasis bold">unconstitutional</strong>. (3) The US Supreme Court has held that the Second Amendment, as applied to the states through the Fourteenth Amendment, protects an individual’s right to possess a usable handgun in the home for self-defense. Although the Court held that an exception could be made for convicted felons, the proposed statute covers <em class="emphasis">any</em> crime that involves alcohol, including misdemeanors (such as misdemeanor DUI). Thus it is overbroad and encroaches on the Second Amendment’s guarantee of the right to bear arms.</li>
            <li>(1) The <strong class="emphasis bold">Eighth Amendment</strong> and the <strong class="emphasis bold">due process clause</strong> in the Fourteenth Amendment are relevant. (2) The proposed statute is most likely <strong class="emphasis bold">unconstitutional</strong>. (3) The proposed statute appears to be inhumane and excessive for the crime, which makes it cruel and unusual punishment.</li>
