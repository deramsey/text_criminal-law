    <p class="para editable block" id="storm_1.0-ch04_s02_p02">States and the federal government vary in their approach to defining criminal intent, and each jurisdiction describes the criminal intent element in a criminal statute, or case, in jurisdictions that allow common-law crimes.

The definition of malice aforethought is “intent to kill.” Society considers intent to kill the most evil of all intents, so malice aforethought crimes such as first- and second-degree murder generally mandate the most severe of punishments, including the death penalty in jurisdictions that allow for it.

Unfortunately, criminal statutes rarely describe their intent element as “specific” or “general,” and a judge may be required to define the level of intent using the common law or a dictionary to explain a word’s ordinary meaning. Typically, specific intent means that the defendant acts with a more sophisticated level of awareness.<span class="footnote" id="storm_1.0-fn04_012">Connecticut Jury Instructions No. 2.3-1, accessed February 14, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.jud.ct.gov/ji/criminal/part2/2.3-1.htm">http://www.jud.ct.gov/ji/criminal/part2/2.3-1.htm</a>.</span> Crimes that require specific intent usually fall into one of three categories: either the defendant intends to cause a certain bad <em class="emphasis">result</em>, the defendant intends to do <em class="emphasis">something more</em> than commit the criminal act, or the defendant acts with knowledge that his or her conduct is illegal, which is called <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">scienter</a><span class="glossdef">The intent to do an unlawful act.</span></span>.</p>

                <p class="para editable block" id="storm_1.0-ch04_s02_s01_s02_s01_p01">A state statute defines mayhem as “physical contact with another, inflicted with the intent to maim, disfigure, or scar.” This statute describes a specific intent crime. To be guilty of mayhem under the statute, the defendant must inflict the physical contact with the intent of causing the bad <em class="emphasis">result</em> of maiming, disfigurement, or scarring. If the prosecution cannot prove this high-level intent, the defendant may be acquitted (or charged and convicted of a lower-level intent crime like battery).</p>

On the other hand, if Pauline slaps Peter while he is shaving without making the comment, and the razor bites into his cheek, it is more challenging to prove that she <em class="emphasis">intended a scarring</em>, and Pauline might be found guilty only of battery.</p>

Scienter can be the basis of <strong class="emphasis bold">specific intent</strong> in some statutes.

Ordinarily, the only direct evidence of intent is a defendant’s confession, which the government cannot forcibly obtain because of the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination. Witnesses who hear the defendant express intent are often unable to testify about it because of evidentiary rules prohibiting hearsay. However, many jurisdictions allow an <strong class="emphasis bold">inference</strong> of general intent based on the criminal <em class="emphasis">act</em>.<span class="footnote" id="storm_1.0-fn04_015"><em class="emphasis">Commonwealth v.

To be guilty of battery under the statute, the defendant must <em class="emphasis">only</em> intend the harmful or offensive contact. The defendant does not have to desire that the contact produces a specific <em class="emphasis">result</em>, such as scarring, or death; nor does the defendant need <strong class="emphasis bold">scienter</strong>, or awareness that the physical contact is illegal.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="storm_1.0-ch04_s02_s01_s03_s02_p02">If Addie balls up her fist and punches Eddie in the jaw after Eddie calls her a “stupid idiot,” Addie has probably committed battery under the statute. A prosecutor could prove that Addie committed the <em class="emphasis">act</em> of harmful or offensive contact using Eddie’s testimony and a physician’s report. The jury could thereafter be instructed to “infer intent from proof of the act.” If the jury accepts the inference and determines that Addie committed the criminal act, the jury could find Addie guilty of battery without additional evidence of intent.</p>

Ignatius has been convicted of child rape in three previous incidents. The jury foreman announces the decision finding Ignatius not guilty. Ignatius looks over his shoulder at Isabella and smirks. Isabella calmly pulls a loaded revolver out of her purse, and then shoots and kills Ignatius. In this case, Isabella’s <em class="emphasis">motive</em> is <em class="emphasis">revenge</em> for the rape of her teenage daughter, or the desire to protect other women from Ignatius’ conduct. This motive generated Isabella’s criminal <em class="emphasis">intent</em>, which is malice aforethought or intent to kill. In spite of Isabella’s motive, which is probably understandable under the circumstances, Isabella can be found guilty of murder because she acted with the murder mens rea. However, Isabella’s motive may be introduced at sentencing and may result in a reduced sentence such as life in prison rather than the death penalty. In addition, Isabella’s motive may affect a prosecutor’s decision to seek the death penalty at all because this would probably be disfavored by the public.</p>

The reckless intent test is two pronged. First, the defendant must consciously disregard a substantial risk of harm. The standard is subjective; the <em class="emphasis">defendant</em> must know of the substantial risk. Second, the defendant must take an unjustifiable risk, meaning that no valid reason exists for the risk. The standard for this prong is objective; if a <em class="emphasis">reasonable person</em> would not take the risk, then the defendant’s action in taking it is <strong class="emphasis bold">reckless</strong>. As the Model Penal Code states, “[t]he risk must be of such a nature and degree that…its disregard involves a gross deviation from the standard of conduct that a law-abiding person would observe in the actor’s situation” (Model Penal Code § 2.02(2) (c)).</p>

                    <li>One important function of intent is the determination of punishment. In general, the more evil the intent, the more severe the punishment.</li>
                    <li>The three common-law intents ranked in order of culpability are malice aforethought, specific intent, and general intent.</li>
                    <li>Specific intent is the intent to bring about a certain result, do something other than the criminal act, or scienter. General intent is simply the intent to perform the criminal act.</li>
                    <li>With a general intent crime, the trier of fact may infer intent from the criminal act. This alleviates the prosecution’s burden of proving criminal intent.</li>
                    <li>Motive is the reason the defendant commits the criminal act. Motive standing alone is not enough to prove criminal intent.</li>
                    <li>The Model Penal Code’s criminal states of mind ranked in order of culpability are purposely, knowingly, recklessly, and negligently. Purposely is similar to specific intent to cause a particular result. Knowingly is awareness that results are practically certain to occur. Recklessly is a subjective awareness of a risk of harm, and an objective and unjustified disregard of that risk. Negligently is not being aware of a substantial risk of harm when a reasonable person would be.</li>
                    <li>The exception to the requirement that every crime contain a criminal intent element is strict liability.</li>
                    <li>Transferred intent promotes justice by holding a defendant responsible for his or her criminal conduct, even though the conduct was intended to harm a different victim.</li>
                    <li>Vicarious liability is the transfer of criminal liability from one criminal defendant to another based on a special relationship.</li>
                    <li>Concurrence requires that act and intent exist at the same moment.</li>

Ct. 1849 (2009)), which is available at this link: <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=10945987555184039397&amp;q=Dean+v.+U.S.&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2,5">http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=10945987555184039397&amp;q= Dean+v.+U.S.&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2,5</a>.</p>
                <p class="para" id="storm_1.0-ch04_s02_s07_s01_p04">In <em class="emphasis">Dean</em>, the defendant was sentenced to ten years imprisonment under a federal sentencing enhancement for an accidental discharge of his firearm during a bank robbery. The prosecution presented evidence at trial indicating that the defendant went into the bank wearing a mask and carrying a loaded firearm. The defendant told everyone in the bank to “get down,” and then went behind the tellers’ station and began grabbing money with his left hand. The gun in his right hand discharged. The defendant seemed surprised by the discharge, cursed, and ran out of the bank. No one was injured or hurt during the robbery.</p>
                <p class="para" id="storm_1.0-ch04_s02_s07_s01_p05">The defendant thereafter admitted he committed the robbery. The US Supreme Court upheld the defendant’s sentencing, in spite of the fact that there was <em class="emphasis">no</em> evidence of <em class="emphasis">intent</em> to discharge the firearm. The Court based its holding on the plain meaning of the statute requiring a minimum sentence of ten years imprisonment when a firearm is discharged during a robbery. The statute, 18 U.S.C. § 924(c) (1) (A), does not expressly state a criminal intent requirement. The Court further held that a presumption of criminal intent was not required. As the Court stated, “[i]t is unusual to impose criminal punishment for the consequences of purely accidental conduct. But it is not unusual to punish individuals for the unintended consequences of their <em class="emphasis">unlawful</em> acts” (<em class="emphasis">Dean v. U.S.</em>, 129 S. Ct. 1849, 1855 (2009)).</p>
