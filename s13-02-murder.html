            <p class="para editable block" id="storm_1.0-ch09_s02_s02_s01_p01">Malice, as used in the term malice aforethought, is not the intent to vex or annoy. Nor is it hatred of the victim. Malice exists when the defendant desires the victim’s death or is indifferent to whether the victim lives or dies. Malice is apparent in three criminal homicide situations: the defendant intends to kill the victim, the defendant intends to cause serious bodily injury to the victim, or the defendant has a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">depraved heart</a><span class="glossdef">The defendant is indifferent to whether the victim lives or dies. Also called abandoned and malignant heart.</span></span> and does not care if the victim lives or dies.</p>

The depraved heart intent is also <strong class="emphasis bold">implied malice</strong><span class="footnote" id="storm_1.0-fn09_012">N.R.S. § 200.020(2), accessed February 13, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://law.onecle.com/nevada/crimes/200.020.html">http://law.onecle.com/nevada/crimes/200.020.html</a>.</span> and corresponds with the Model Penal Code’s <strong class="emphasis bold">knowingly</strong> or <strong class="emphasis bold">recklessly</strong> murder mental states, depending on the attendant circumstances.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="storm_1.0-ch09_s02_s05_p02">A <em class="emphasis">justifiable homicide</em> is a homicide that is warranted under the circumstances. One example of a justifiable homicide is when a law enforcement officer shoots and kills a fleeing felon to prevent imminent great bodily injury or death. This killing is intentional and <strong class="emphasis bold">purposeful</strong> with <strong class="emphasis bold">malice aforethought</strong>, but it is noncriminal. The justification negates the criminality and the law enforcement officer will not be convicted of murder. A complete discussion of use of deadly force by law enforcement to arrest or apprehend a criminal defendant is in <a class="xref" href="storm_1.0-ch05#storm_1.0-ch05">Chapter 5 "Criminal Defenses, Part 1"</a>.

        <p class="para editable block" id="storm_1.0-ch09_s02_s05_p03">An <em class="emphasis">excusable homicide</em> is a homicide that society forgives or pardons.

Implied malice, knowingly, and recklessly includes the intent to commit serious bodily injury and depraved heart intent.</li>
                <li>The deadly weapon doctrine creates an inference of murder intent when the defendant uses a deadly weapon. If the trier of fact accepts the inference, the prosecution does not have the burden of proving criminal intent.</li>
