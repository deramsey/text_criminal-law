        <h3 class="title">Summary</h3>
        <p class="para" id="storm_1.0-ch01_s07_p01">A crime is action or inaction in violation of a criminal law. Criminal laws vary from state to state and from state to federal.</p>
        <p class="para" id="storm_1.0-ch01_s07_p02">The study of criminal law defines crimes and defenses to crimes. The study of criminal procedure focuses on the enforcement of rights by individuals while submitting to government investigation, arrest, interrogation, trial, and appeal.</p>
        <p class="para" id="storm_1.0-ch01_s07_p03">A civil lawsuit or civil litigation matter resolves a dispute between individuals, called a plaintiff (the injured party) and defendant (the alleged wrongdoer). Every civil litigation matter includes a victim (the plaintiff), which has suffered harm. The goal of the civil litigation matter is to compensate the plaintiff for injury. The court can compensate the plaintiff by awarding money, which is called damages. Both parties in a civil litigation matter must represent themselves or hire private attorneys.</p>
        <p class="para" id="storm_1.0-ch01_s07_p04">A criminal prosecution takes place when the government, represented by a prosecutor, takes legal action against the defendant (the alleged wrongdoer) for committing a crime. Some criminal prosecutions do not include a victim, or harm, because the goal of the criminal prosecution is punishment, not compensation. Every criminal prosecution involves the government, so the US and state constitutions provide the criminal defendant with extra protections not present in a civil lawsuit, such as free counsel when the defendant is indigent and facing incarceration.</p>
        <p class="para" id="storm_1.0-ch01_s07_p05">Crimes can be classified according to the severity of punishment. The most serious crimes with the entire range of sentencing options available are felonies. Misdemeanors are less serious than felonies and have less severe sentencing options. Felony-misdemeanors can be prosecuted and punished as a felony or a misdemeanor, depending on the circumstances. Infractions, also called violations, are the least serious crimes and generally do not involve incarceration. The purposes of punishing a criminal defendant are both specific and general deterrence, incapacitation, rehabilitation, retribution, and restitution.</p>
        <p class="para" id="storm_1.0-ch01_s07_p06">Law comes from three sources: the Constitution, a statute, or a case. The Constitution is the highest source of law but is only applicable when there is government action. Statutory law applies to individuals but is inferior to constitutional law. Case law is law made by judges when they rule on the facts of a case. Although case law is technically inferior to statutory law, judges must interpret statutes and the Constitution, so case law can be the most powerful source of law. When a case invalidates a statute as unconstitutional, this action is called judicial review. Case law stays consistent because judges follow previous court decisions, called precedent. This policy, called stare decisis, lends predictability to case law but is not absolute, and courts can deviate from it to update the law.</p>

            <li>This crime is probably a <em class="emphasis">misdemeanor</em> because Harrison was sentenced to one year in <em class="emphasis">jail</em>, rather than prison.

            <li>The Iowa Court of Appeals based its ruling on New Jersey law. Although New Jersey named the offenses “high misdemeanors,” New Jersey case law indicates that any offense with a sentence of one year or more incarceration is a common-law <em class="emphasis">felony</em>.

            <li>The court awards criminal restitution to the victim after a state or federal prosecutor is successful in a criminal trial.

The trial court determined that the defendant had <em class="emphasis">actually</em> stolen $100,000 and awarded restitution of $100,000 to various victims. The defendant claimed that this amount was excessive because it exceeded the parameters of the theft statute he was convicted of violating. The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals <em class="emphasis">disagreed</em> and held that the discretion of how much restitution to award belongs to the judge.

            <li>The reason criminal defendants get special protections not extended to civil litigation defendants is the harshness of the <em class="emphasis">punishment</em> and the <em class="emphasis">inequality</em> of the criminal prosecution itself. Criminal defendants may lose their life or their liberty. Civil litigation defendants risk only a loss of <em class="emphasis">money</em>. In addition, criminal defendants face the intimidating prospect of fighting the government and all its vast resources. Civil litigation defendants are squaring off against <em class="emphasis">another individual</em>. As a society, we believe that there is nothing as unjust as punishing an innocent person. Thus we give criminal defendants special protections to level the playing field.</li>

            <li>In this case, the <em class="emphasis">plaintiffs</em> are seeking an <em class="emphasis">injunction</em>. The plaintiffs are not the <em class="emphasis">government</em>; they are a group of fish. They are not suing for the goal of punishment, but rather to compel the president of the United States and the secretary of defense to review the use of certain naval equipment.

            <li>The Court is reviewing the Sixth Amendment right to confront accusers. In this case, a witness who was too ill to travel was permitted to testify via live, two-way video instead of testifying in the courtroom in front of the defendant. The New York Supreme Court held that under the circumstances, this testimony complied with the Sixth Amendment.
