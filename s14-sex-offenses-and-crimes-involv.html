        <h2 class="title editable block">Synopsis of the History of Rape and Sodomy</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="storm_1.0-ch10_s01_s01_p01">The word <strong class="emphasis bold">rape</strong> has its roots in the Latin word <em class="emphasis">rapere</em>, which means to steal or seize. At early common law, rape was a capital offense. The elements of rape were forcible sexual intercourse, by a man, with a woman not the spouse of the perpetrator, conducted without consent, or with consent obtained by force or threat of force.<span class="footnote" id="storm_1.0-fn10_001">Donna Macnamara, “History of Sexual Violence,” Interactive theatre.org website, accessed February 8, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.interactivetheatre.org/resc/history.html">http://www.interactivetheatre.org/resc/history.html</a>.</span> The rape prosecution required evidence of the defendant’s use of force, extreme resistance by the victim, and evidence that corroborated the rape victim’s testimony. The common law also recognized the crime of <strong class="emphasis bold">sodomy</strong>. In general, sodomy was the penetration of the male anus by a man. Sodomy was condemned and criminalized even <em class="emphasis">with consent</em> because of religious beliefs deeming it a crime against nature.<span class="footnote" id="storm_1.0-fn10_002">“Sex Offenses,” Lawbrain.com website, accessed February 8, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://lawbrain.com/wiki/Sex_Offenses">http://lawbrain.com/wiki/Sex_Offenses</a>.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="storm_1.0-ch10_s01_s01_p02">In the 1970s, many changes were made to rape statutes, updating the antiquated common-law approach and increasing the chances of conviction. The most prominent changes were eliminating the marital rape exemption and the requirement of evidence to corroborate the rape victim’s testimony, creating rape shield laws to protect the victim, and relaxing the necessity for the defendant’s use of force or resistance by the victim.<span class="footnote" id="storm_1.0-fn10_003">Matthew R. Lyon, “No means No? Withdrawal of Consent During Intercourse and the Continuing Evolution of the Definition of Rape,” Findarticles.com website, accessed February 8, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_hb6700/is_1_95/ai_n29148498/pg_3/?tag=content;col1">http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_hb6700/is_1_95/ai_n29148498/pg_3/?tag=content;col1</a>.</span> Many jurisdictions also changed the name of rape to sexual battery, sexual assault, or unlawful sexual conduct and combined sexual offenses like rape, sodomy, and oral copulation into one statute. Although some states still have statutes that provide the death penalty for rape, the US Supreme Court has held that rape, even <em class="emphasis">child rape</em>, cannot be considered a <strong class="emphasis bold">capital</strong> offense without violating the Eighth Amendment cruel and unusual punishment clause, rendering these statutes unenforceable.<span class="footnote" id="storm_1.0-fn10_004"><em class="emphasis">Kennedy v.

        <p class="para editable block" id="storm_1.0-ch10_s01_s01_p03">Sodomy law has likewise been updated to make sodomy a gender-neutral offense and preclude the criminalization of consensual sexual conduct between adults. The US Supreme Court has definitively held that consensual sex between adults may be protected by a right of privacy and cannot be criminalized without a sufficient government interest.<span class="footnote" id="storm_1.0-fn10_005"><em class="emphasis">Lawrence v.

Brad tells Alex he is going to go the store and purchase some beer. While Brad is gone, Alex turns to Brandy, pulls a knife out of his pocket, and tells her to take off her pants and lie down. Brandy tells Alex, “No, I don’t want to,” but thereafter acquiesces, and Alex puts his penis into Brandy’s vagina. Alex has probably committed the criminal act element required for rape in most jurisdictions. Although Alex did not use physical force to accomplish sexual intercourse, his <em class="emphasis">threat</em> of force by display of the knife is sufficient. If the situation is reversed, and Brandy pulls out the knife and orders Alex to put his penis in her vagina, many jurisdictions would also criminalize Brandy’s criminal act as rape. If Alex does not use force or a threat of force, but Brandy is only nine years old, some jurisdictions still criminalize Alex’s act as rape, as would the Model Penal Code.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="storm_1.0-ch10_s01_s10_p01">Based on a public awareness that sex offenders often reoffend, many states have enacted some form of <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Megan’s law</a><span class="glossdef">A statute requiring sex offender registration and notification to the public of the location of a sex offender.</span></span> or <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Jessica’s law</a><span class="glossdef">A statute requiring monitoring of a sex offender.</span></span>, which provide for registration, monitoring, control, and elevated sentencing for sex offenders, including those that harm children. Both laws were written and enacted after high-profile cases with child victims became the subject of enormous media attention.

            <ul class="itemizedlist" id="storm_1.0-ch10_s01_s10_l01">
                <li>Common-law rape was a capital offense, did not include rape of a spouse, required extreme resistance by the victim, and required evidence to corroborate a victim’s testimony. Modern statutes do not make rape a capital offense, often criminalize spousal rape, and do not require extreme resistance by the victim or evidence to corroborate the victim’s testimony. At early common law, sodomy was the anal penetration of a man, by a man. Modern statutes make sodomy gender-neutral and only criminalize sodomy without consent.</li>
                <li>The criminal act element required for rape is sexual penetration accomplished with force or threat of force in many jurisdictions.</li>
                <li>The attendant circumstance element required for rape is lack of consent by the victim.</li>
                <li>In many jurisdictions, the victim does not need to resist if the defendant uses force. If the victim is faced with a threat of force rather than force, the victim need not resist if he or she has a subjective fear of serious bodily injury, and this fear is reasonable under the circumstances.</li>
                <li>In modern times, a victim’s testimony does not need to be corroborated by other evidence to convict a defendant of rape.</li>
                <li>The criminal intent element required for rape is general intent or knowingly to commit the criminal act.</li>
                <li>In some jurisdictions, the criminal intent element required for the rape attendant circumstance is negligent intent—providing for a defense of mistake of fact as to the victim’s consent. In other jurisdictions, the criminal intent element required for the rape attendant circumstance is strict liability, which does not allow for the mistake of fact defense.</li>
                <li>The harm element required for rape is penetration, no matter how slight. Ejaculation is not a requirement for rape in most jurisdictions.</li>
                <li>Rape shield laws generally preclude the admission of evidence of the victim’s past sexual conduct in a rape trial, unless it is allowed by a judge at an in camera hearing. Rape shield laws also preclude the admission of evidence of the victim’s style of dress and the victim’s request that the defendant wear a condom to prove victim consent. Some rape shield laws provide that the victim’s testimony need not be corroborated by other evidence to convict the defendant of rape.</li>
                <li>Acquaintance rape often goes unreported and does not necessarily include use of force by the defendant or resistance by the victim.</li>
                <li>States that criminalize spousal rape generally require the same elements for spousal rape as for rape and grade spousal rape the same as rape.</li>
                <li>Statutory rape is generally sexual intercourse with a victim who is under the age of legal consent. Statutory rape does not have the requirement that the intercourse be forcible and does not require the attendant circumstance of the victim’s lack of consent because the victim is incapable of rendering legal consent. In the majority of jurisdictions, the criminal intent element required for statutory rape is strict liability. In a minority of jurisdictions, the criminal intent element required for statutory rape is negligent or reckless intent, providing for a defense of mistake of fact as to the victim’s age.</li>
                <li>Sodomy has the same elements as rape except for the criminal act element, which is often defined as forcible penis to anus penetration, rather than penis to vagina penetration. In addition, in some states sodomy is criminal with consent when it occurs in a state prison or a local detention facility or jail. Oral copulation also has the same elements as rape, except for the criminal act element, which is forcible mouth to sexual organ or anus penetration. Incest is sexual intercourse between family members who cannot legally marry.</li>
                <li>Generally, rape, sodomy, and oral copulation are graded as serious felonies. Factors that enhance grading of sex offenses are penetration, gang rape, bodily injury, the use of a weapon, a victim who has intellectual or mental disabilities or is youthful or intoxicated, and the commission of other crimes in concert with the sex offense. Sex offenses committed with the victim’s consent and without penetration are typically graded lower. If the victim is below the age of consent, a large age difference exists between the defendant and the victim, the defendant is an adult, or the victim is of tender years, grading typically is enhanced.</li>
                <li>Typically, a Megan’s law statute provides for sex offender registration and notification to the public that a convicted sex offender lives in their area. A Jessica’s law statute often includes a stay-away order mandating that a sex offender cannot live within a certain distance from areas such as a school or park where children tend to congregate. Jessica’s law statutes also provide for GPS monitoring and extend the sentencing and parole terms of child sex offenders.</li>

                <li>Jorge and Christina have consensual sexual intercourse. Could this consensual sexual intercourse be criminal? Which crime(s), if any, could exist in this fact pattern?</li>
                <li>Read <em class="emphasis">Toomer v. State</em>, 529 SE 2d 719 (2000). In <em class="emphasis">Toomer</em>, the defendant was convicted of rape after having sexual intercourse with his daughter, who was under the age of fourteen. The jury instruction did not include any requirement for the defendant’s use of force or victim resistance. The defendant appealed and claimed that the prosecution should have proven he used force and the victim’s resistance because the charge was <strong class="emphasis bold">rape</strong>, not <strong class="emphasis bold">statutory rape</strong>. Did the Supreme Court of South Carolina uphold the defendant’s conviction? Why or why not?

The defendant can touch the victim with an instrumentality, like shooting the victim with a gun, or can hit the victim with a thrown object, such as rocks or a bottle. The defendant can also touch the victim with a vehicle, knife, or a substance, such as spitting on the victim or spraying the victim with a hose.</p>

The Model Penal Code requires purposely, knowingly, or recklessly causing bodily injury to another, or negligently causing “bodily injury to another with a deadly weapon” (Model Penal Code § 211.1(1) (b)).

The Model Penal Code grades <em class="emphasis">aggravated</em> battery (called aggravated assault), which is battery that causes serious bodily injury or bodily injury caused by a deadly weapon, as a felony of the second or third degree (Model Penal Code § 211.1(2)).

            <ul class="itemizedlist" id="storm_1.0-ch10_s02_s03_l01">
                <li>The criminal act element required for battery is an unlawful touching.</li>
                <li>The criminal intent element required for battery can be specific intent or purposely, general intent or knowingly, recklessly, or negligently, depending on the circumstances and the jurisdiction. Jurisdictions that criminalize reckless or negligent battery generally require actual injury, serious bodily injury, or the use of a deadly weapon.</li>
                <li>The attendant circumstance element required for battery is lack of consent by the victim.</li>
                <li>The harm element of battery is physical contact. Jurisdictions vary as to whether the physical contact must be harmful or if it can be harmful or offensive.</li>
                <li>Battery that causes offense or emotional injury is typically graded as a misdemeanor, and battery that causes physical injury is typically graded as a gross misdemeanor or a felony. Factors that can aggravate grading are a higher level of intent, such as intent to maim or disfigure, use of a weapon, committing battery in concert with other serious or violent felonies, and battery against a helpless victim, teacher, or law enforcement officer.</li>
                <li>Attempted battery assault is an attempt crime that does not require the elements of causation or harm. Threatened battery assault requires causation and harm; the victim must experience reasonable fear of imminent physical contact.</li>
                <li>Attempted battery assault requires the criminal act of substantial steps toward commission of a battery and the criminal intent of specific intent or purposely to commit a battery. Because attempted battery assault is an attempt crime, it also generally requires present ability to commit the battery.</li>
                <li>The criminal act element required for threatened battery assault is conduct that inspires reasonable fear in the victim of imminent harmful or offensive physical contact. Words generally are not enough to constitute the criminal act element, nor are conditional threats. However, because the act need only inspire the fear, rather than culminate in a battery, apparent ability to commit the battery is sufficient in many jurisdictions. The criminal intent element required for threatened battery assault is specific intent or purposely to inspire the victim’s reasonable fear. The defendant must also be the factual and legal cause of the harm, which is the victim’s reasonable fear of imminent harmful or offensive physical contact.</li>
                <li>Simple assault is generally graded as a misdemeanor; aggravated assault is generally graded as a felony. Factors that can aggravate grading are the use of a weapon or assault against a law enforcement officer, teacher, or helpless victim.</li>

Although family cruelty or interfamily criminal behavior is not a new phenomenon, enforcement of criminal statutes against family members can be challenging because of dependence, fear, and other issues that are particular to the family unit. In addition, historical evidence indicates that law enforcement can be reluctant to get involved in <em class="emphasis">family disputes</em> and often fails to adequately <em class="emphasis">protect</em> victims who are trapped in the same residence as the defendant. Specific enforcement measures that are crafted to apply to defendants and victims who are family members are an innovative statutory approach that many jurisdictions are beginning to adopt. In general, domestic violence statutes target crimes against the person, for example, assault, battery, sex offenses, kidnapping, and criminal homicide.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Stalking</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="storm_1.0-ch10_s03_s02_p01">California was the first state to enact a stalking law in 1990, in response to the high-profile murder of a young actress named Rebecca Schaeffer whose attacker stalked her for two years. Now <em class="emphasis">all states</em> and the federal government have stalking laws.<span class="footnote" id="storm_1.0-fn10_102">18 U.S.C. § 2261A, accessed February 22, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.ncvc.org/src/main.aspx?dbID=DB_Federal_Interstate_Stalking_Institute163#61a">http://www.ncvc.org/src/main.aspx?dbID=DB_Federal_Interstate_Stalking_Institute163#61a</a>.</span> Although statutes criminalizing stalking are gender-neutral, in reality, most stalking victims are women, and most stalking defendants are men.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="storm_1.0-ch10_s03_s02_p02">Before the states enacted stalking laws, a victim who was threatened and harassed but not assaulted had no remedy except to go to court and obtain a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">restraining order</a><span class="glossdef">A court order forbidding the defendant from contacting or coming within a certain distance of the victim.</span></span>. A restraining order is a court order mandating that the defendant neither contact nor come within a certain distance of the victim. If the defendant violated the restraining order, law enforcement could arrest him or her. Until a restraining order was in place, however, the defendant was free to continue frightening the victim. Restraining orders typically take some time to obtain. The victim must contact and employ an attorney and also set up a court hearing. For this reason, the restraining order method of preventing a defendant from stalking was cumbersome, ineffective, and frequently resulted in force or violence against the stalking victim.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="storm_1.0-ch10_s03_s02_p03">The modern crime of stalking allows law enforcement to arrest and incapacitate defendants <em class="emphasis">before</em> they complete an assault, battery, or other violent crime against a victim. Like all crimes, stalking requires the defendant to commit a voluntary act supported by criminal intent. In many jurisdictions, stalking also has the elements of causation and harm, as is discussed in <a class="xref" href="#storm_1.0-ch10_s03_s02">Section 10.3.2 "Stalking"</a>.</p>

Lisa frowns and walks away. Elliot then follows Lisa and tells her that he will “make her pay” for not loving him. Lisa ignores Elliot’s statement, climbs into her car, and drives away. Later that evening, Elliot rings Lisa’s doorbell. Lisa does not answer the door but yells at Elliot, telling him to leave. Disgruntled and angry, Elliot carves, “you will die for not loving me” into Lisa’s front door with his pocketknife.</p>

                    <li>Individuals covered by domestic violence statutes are relatives by blood or marriage, individuals who share a child, ex-spouses and ex-lovers, and individuals who reside together.</li>
                    <li>Some special features of domestic violence statutes are special training for law enforcement in domestic issues, protection of the victim by no-contact orders and nondisclosure of the victim’s residence address, the duty of law enforcement or prosecutors to inform the victim of the decision of whether to prosecute and the duty to inform the victim of special procedures available to protect domestic violence victims, the ability to arrest domestic violence offenders with or without a warrant, special factors to consider in the sentencing of domestic violence defendants, and peace officer immunity for enforcement of domestic violence provisions.</li>
                    <li>The criminal act element required for stalking varies, but in general it is repeatedly engaging in a course of conduct that poses a credible threat to the victim’s safety, including following, harassing, approaching, or pursuing the victim.</li>
                    <li>The criminal intent supporting the stalking criminal act is specific intent or purposely in most jurisdictions. Some jurisdictions require a different criminal intent to support the harm requirement: either specific intent or purposely, general intent or knowingly, reckless intent, negligent intent, or strict liability.</li>
                    <li>Some jurisdictions require the defendant to cause harm, which is victim fear of serious bodily injury, fear of death of the victim or the victim’s family member, or damage to the victim’s property. The test for victim fear varies and could be either subjective and objective fear, just subjective fear, or just objective fear.</li>
                    <li>It is common to divide stalking into degrees or grade it as simple and aggravated. First-degree or aggravated stalking is generally graded as a felony, and second-degree or simple stalking is generally graded as a misdemeanor. Factors that can aggravate grading are the violation of a restraining or protective order, the use of a weapon, a youthful victim, or previous convictions for stalking.</li>

                <li>False imprisonment is often a lesser included offense of kidnapping, missing the asportation element, and requiring general intent or knowing commission of the criminal act. False imprisonment is also graded lower than kidnapping as either a gross misdemeanor or a low-level felony.</li>
                <li>Two potential defenses to kidnapping and false imprisonment are victim consent and a lawful arrest by a law enforcement officer or citizen.</li>

                <li>Read <em class="emphasis">State v. Salaman</em>, 949 A.2d 1092 (2008). In <em class="emphasis">Salaman</em>, the defendant grabbed the victim, pinned her to the stairs for five minutes, punched her in the face, and violently stuck his fingers down her throat. He was thereafter convicted of second-degree kidnapping and appealed, claiming his restraint of the victim was merely <strong class="emphasis bold">incidental</strong> to the crime of assault. In Connecticut, the state where the offense occurred, the kidnapping criminal act is restraint with the specific intent to prevent the victim’s liberation. Connecticut also had case precedent holding that restraint that is incidental to the commission of a separate offense is still kidnapping. Did the Supreme Court of Connecticut uphold the defendant’s conviction?

        <h3 class="title">Summary</h3>
        <p class="para" id="storm_1.0-ch10_s05_p01">States vary as to how they categorize and grade sex offenses. In general, rape is knowing, forcible sexual intercourse without consent or with consent obtained involuntarily. Although the victim had to resist to indicate lack of consent at early common law, in modern times the victim need not resist if it would be futile to do so. Another modernization from common-law rape is the elimination of an exemption for spousal rape and the elimination of the requirement that victim testimony in a rape case be corroborated. Most states have rape shield laws that govern the admissibility of evidence of the victim’s past sexual conduct at a trial for rape. Sodomy and oral copulation are sometimes combined and included with rape in one statute called sexual assault. If sodomy and oral copulation are the subject of separate statutes, sodomy is typically knowing forcible penis to anus penetration, and oral copulation is typically knowing forcible mouth to sexual organ or anus penetration. Statutory rape is generally sexual intercourse with an underage victim either recklessly, negligently, or with strict liability depending on the jurisdiction, and incest is generally knowing sexual intercourse between family members who cannot marry. States vary as to how they grade sex offenses, with force and penetration enhancing the grading to a felony in most jurisdictions.</p>
        <p class="para" id="storm_1.0-ch10_s05_p02">Assault and battery are often included in the same statute (called assault) but are actually separate offenses with distinct elements. Battery is generally a purposeful, knowing, reckless, or negligent (depending on the jurisdiction) unlawful harmful or offensive touching without victim consent. Assault can be attempted battery, in which case all the elements of battery except the physical contact are present, or threatened battery, which is a purposeful act that causes apprehension of harmful or offensive physical contact in the victim. Simple battery and simple assault are typically misdemeanors, while aggravated versions of these offenses are often felonies. Factors that can aggravate the grading of assault and battery are the use of a weapon or serious injury.</p>
        <p class="para" id="storm_1.0-ch10_s05_p03">Domestic violence statutes criminalize conduct such as assault, battery, sex offenses, or criminal homicide between family members and have special provisions that pertain to interfamily violence. Stalking criminalizes a purposeful course of conduct that poses a credible threat to the victim’s safety. Cyberstalking is the use of the Internet or e-mail to commit stalking. Simple stalking is generally a misdemeanor, while aggravated stalking, which is stalking that causes injury or violates a restraining order, is generally a felony.</p>
        <p class="para" id="storm_1.0-ch10_s05_p04">Kidnapping is the purposeful confinement and asportation (movement) of a victim for the purpose of injuring or harming the victim or another, hiding the victim in secret, obtaining a ransom, committing a separate offense, subjecting the victim to involuntary servitude, or interfering with the purpose of government or political function. False imprisonment is a lesser included offense of kidnapping that does not include asportation or specific intent. Interference with custody is parental kidnapping or violation of a child custody or visitation agreement. While kidnapping is typically a felony, false imprisonment and interference with custody are generally graded lower, as either a gross misdemeanor or low-level felony.</p>

            <li>The sexual intercourse could be <strong class="emphasis bold">rape</strong> or <strong class="emphasis bold">statutory rape</strong> if either Jorge or Christina (or both) are incapable of rendering legal consent because they are below the age of consent, have mental or intellectual disabilities, or are intoxicated. If Jorge and Christina are incapable of marrying because of a family relationship, their sexual intercourse could be <strong class="emphasis bold">incest</strong>.</li>
            <li>The South Carolina Supreme Court upheld the defendant’s conviction on the grounds that force and victim resistance are <em class="emphasis">not required</em> when a victim is under the age of legal consent. The court specifically stated that the victim’s inability to legally consent vitiates the need to prove the defendant’s use of force for rape.</li>
            <li>The Court of Appeals of Texas held that state legislatures have broad powers to define crimes and criminal intent requirements, including the power to <em class="emphasis">eliminate</em> a culpable mental state. Thus the court upheld the defendant’s conviction and did not strike the strict liability aggravated sexual assault statute. The court reviewed significant state and federal precedent to determine that the majority of states disallow the mistake of age defense, and that this does not violate federal or Texas state <strong class="emphasis bold">due process</strong> because it is supported by the legitimate government interest of protecting children.</li>

            <li>In the first scenario where Bob swings once and misses, then swings again and connects, two crimes have been committed: assault and battery. The first swing that misses is an assault.

            <li>The defendant threw a cup of urine in the victim’s face. Although the battery statute in Wisconsin requires <strong class="emphasis bold">bodily harm</strong>, the court held that the stinging sensation in the victim’s eyes was sufficient and upheld the defendant’s conviction.</li>
            <li>The Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts upheld the defendant’s conviction, reasoning that the defendant’s <strong class="emphasis bold">apparent ability</strong> to consummate the shooting is what is essential to the crime of assault with a deadly weapon, not the secret fact that the gun is loaded with blanks rather than bullets.</li>

        <h3 class="title">Answer to Law and Ethics Question</h3>
        <ol class="orderedlist" id="storm_1.0-ch10_s05_l10">
            <li>Rape shield laws focus on the protection of the victim <em class="emphasis">at trial</em> and preclude the admission of evidence of the victim’s sexual history (other than a sexual history with the defendant). They do not necessarily prevent the media from publishing information about the victim or from taunting the victim. Of course, in the Bryant case, this publication ended up badly demoralizing and frightening the victim, leading to the eventual demise of the rape case against Bryant. However, blanket prohibitions against publication of information by the media would be <strong class="emphasis bold">overbroad</strong> and would violate the <strong class="emphasis bold">First Amendment</strong>. A balance must be present between protection of the victim, preservation of the right to a fair trial, and freedom of speech. This case illustrates the damage the media can do to a fair trial, unprejudiced jury, and a willing and cooperative victim. However, the public’s right to know is also paramount and cannot be sublimated without narrow tailoring and a compelling government interest.</li>

        <ol class="orderedlist" id="storm_1.0-ch10_s05_l11">
            <li>The crime is <strong class="emphasis bold">rape</strong>. Although <em class="emphasis">nonforcible</em>, sexual intercourse with an inebriated or unconscious victim is still rape. Rape can be committed by a woman in most jurisdictions. Rape is a <strong class="emphasis bold">felony</strong>.</li>
            <li>The crime is <strong class="emphasis bold">simple battery</strong>, as long as your jurisdiction criminalizes “offensive” physical contact. Simple battery is a <strong class="emphasis bold">misdemeanor</strong>.</li>
            <li>The crime is <strong class="emphasis bold">threatened battery assault</strong>. Threatened battery assault typically requires apparent, rather than present, ability. Threatened battery assault that does not involve a deadly weapon is a <strong class="emphasis bold">misdemeanor</strong>.</li>
            <li>The crime is <strong class="emphasis bold">assault with a deadly weapon</strong>. The defendant committed the assault with a deadly weapon and inflicted it against a law enforcement officer, so the assault is a <strong class="emphasis bold">felony</strong>.</li>
            <li>The crime is <strong class="emphasis bold">kidnapping</strong>.

Kidnapping is a <strong class="emphasis bold">felony</strong>.</li>
