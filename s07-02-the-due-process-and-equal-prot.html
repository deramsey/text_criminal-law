                <p class="para editable block" id="storm_1.0-ch03_s02_s01_s01_s01_p01">A state legislature enacts a statute that criminalizes “inappropriate attire on public beaches.” Larry, a law enforcement officer, arrests Kathy for wearing a two-piece bathing suit at the beach because in his belief, women should wear one-piece bathing suits. Two days later, Burt, another law enforcement officer, arrests Sarah for wearing a one-piece bathing suit at the beach because in his belief, women should not be seen in public in bathing suits. Kathy and Sarah can attack the statute on its face and as applied as void for vagueness. The term “inappropriate” is unclear and can mean different things to different people. Thus it gives too much discretion to law enforcement, is subject to uneven application, and does not give Kathy, Sarah, or the public adequate notice of what behavior is criminal.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="storm_1.0-ch03_s02_s02_p02">The prohibition on governmental discrimination is not absolute; it depends on the class of persons targeted for special treatment. In general, court scrutiny is heightened according to a sliding scale when the subject of discrimination is an arbitrary classification. Arbitrary means random and often includes characteristics an individual is born with, such as race or national origin. The most arbitrary classifications demand <strong class="emphasis bold">strict scrutiny</strong>, which means the criminal statute must be supported by a <em class="emphasis">compelling</em> government interest. Statutes containing classifications that are not arbitrary must have a <strong class="emphasis bold">rational basis</strong> and be supported by a <em class="emphasis">legitimate</em> government interest.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="storm_1.0-ch03_s02_s02_p03">Criminal statutes that classify individuals based on their race must be given strict scrutiny because race is an arbitrary classification that cannot be justified. Modern courts do not uphold criminal statutes that classify based on race because there is no government interest in treating citizens of a different race more or less harshly.<span class="footnote" id="storm_1.0-fn03_009"><em class="emphasis">Loving v.

        <p class="para editable block" id="storm_1.0-ch03_s02_s02_p04">Criminal statutes that have a rational basis for discrimination and are supported by a legitimate government interest <em class="emphasis">can</em> discriminate, and frequently do. Criminal statutes that punish felons more severely when they have a history of criminal behavior, for example, three-strikes statutes, are supported by the legitimate government interests of specific and general deterrence and incapacitation. Note that the basis of the discrimination, a criminal defendant’s <em class="emphasis">status as a convicted felon</em>, is rational, not arbitrary like race. Thus although these statutes discriminate, they are constitutional pursuant to the equal protection clause.</p>
