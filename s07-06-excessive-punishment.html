            <p class="para editable block" id="storm_1.0-ch03_s06_s01_s01_p01">The death penalty has been used as a criminal punishment since the eighteenth century BC. American death penalty law is influenced by the British because the colonists brought English common-law principles, including capital punishment, with them to the New World. The first execution in America took place in 1608, for spying.<span class="footnote" id="storm_1.0-fn03_044">Death Penalty Information Center, “Introduction to the Death Penalty,” deathpenaltyinfo.org website, accessed October 17, 2010, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/part-i-history-death-penalty">http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/part-i-history-death-penalty</a>.</span> Methods of execution and capital crimes varied from colony to colony. In the late 1700s, a movement to abolish the death penalty began, and in 1846 Michigan was the first state to eliminate the death penalty for all crimes except treason.<span class="footnote" id="storm_1.0-fn03_045">Death Penalty Information Center, “Introduction to the Death Penalty,” deathpenaltyinfo.org website, accessed October 17, 2010, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/part-i-history-death-penalty">http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/part-i-history-death-penalty</a>.</span> Throughout the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, the United States fluctuated in its attitude toward capital punishment. Executions were at an all-time high in the 1930s.<span class="footnote" id="storm_1.0-fn03_046">Death Penalty Information Center, “Introduction to the Death Penalty,” deathpenaltyinfo.org website, accessed October 17, 2010, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/part-i-history-death-penalty">http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/part-i-history-death-penalty</a>.</span> However, in 1972, in the landmark decision of <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=3510234117314043073&amp;q=Furman+v.+Georgia&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2,5&amp;as_vis=1"><em class="emphasis">Furman v.

            <p class="para editable block" id="storm_1.0-ch03_s06_s01_s02_p01">A claim that capital punishment is <em class="emphasis">inhumane</em> and therefore unconstitutional under the Eighth Amendment focuses on the <em class="emphasis">method</em> of execution. Throughout the history of the death penalty, many methods of execution have been employed, including shooting, hanging, electrocution, the gas chamber, and lethal injection. At the time of this writing, the law is in a state of flux as to which methods of execution are constitutional because many state and federal decisions have stricken virtually every method available. The current focus of the courts is <em class="emphasis">lethal injection</em> because it is one of the few methods that has not been condemned as unconstitutional. Most states that authorize the death penalty use lethal injection as the primary method of execution. In a recent statement on this issue, the US Supreme Court in <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=10752510346595419167&amp;q=Baze+v.+Rees&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2,5"><em class="emphasis">Baze v.

Although the states and the federal government have designated many capital crimes that may not result in death, for example, treason that does not lead to death, the US Supreme Court has confirmed that the death penalty is too severe for most crimes.

The only crime against an individual that currently merits the death penalty is criminal homicide, which is the unlawful killing of one human being by another.

        <p class="para editable block" id="storm_1.0-ch03_s06_s03_p01">Modern US Supreme Court precedent has expanded the jury’s role in sentencing pursuant to the Sixth Amendment. Although a detailed discussion of sentencing procedure is beyond the scope of this book, a brief overview of sentencing and the roles of the judge and jury is necessary to a fundamental understanding of this important trial right, as is set forth in the following section.</p>
        <div class="section" id="storm_1.0-ch03_s06_s03_s01">
            <h2 class="title editable block">The Role of the Judge and Jury in Sentencing Fact-Finding</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="storm_1.0-ch03_s06_s03_s01_p01">As stated in <a class="xref" href="storm_1.0-ch02#storm_1.0-ch02">Chapter 2 "The Legal System in the United States"</a>, the trier of fact decides the facts and renders a decision on innocence or guilt using <strong class="emphasis bold">beyond a reasonable doubt</strong> as the standard for the burden of proof. The trier of fact in a criminal prosecution is almost always a <em class="emphasis">jury</em> because of the right to a jury trial in the Sixth Amendment. Occasionally, the defendant waives the right to a jury trial and has a bench trial with a judge playing the role of trier of fact. Although the jury determines innocence or guilt during a jury trial, the verdict defines the end of their role as the trier of fact, and the <em class="emphasis">judge</em> sets the sentence. The death penalty is an exception to the jury’s limited role in sentencing; a jury must decide whether to sentence the defendant to death at a separate hearing after the trial has concluded.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="storm_1.0-ch03_s06_s03_s01_p02">Generally, criminal sentencing takes place after the trial. Although the sentencing procedure varies from state to state and from state to federal, a sentencing hearing is typically held after guilt has been determined at trial or after a guilty plea. For many years, judges have had almost <em class="emphasis">exclusive</em> control of sentencing. Although judges are restricted by the fact-finding done at trial, they can receive new evidence at sentencing if it is relevant. For example, a judge is bound by a jury determination that the defendant used a weapon when committing an armed robbery. However, the judge can accept new evidence at sentencing that reveals the defendant had two prior convictions for armed robbery and can enhance the sentence under a habitual offender or three-strikes statute.</p>

                <p class="para editable block" id="storm_1.0-ch03_s06_s03_s01_s01_p01">Until recently, judges could use evidence received at the sentencing hearing to enhance a sentence beyond the statutory maximum by making a determination of the <em class="emphasis">new</em> facts to a <strong class="emphasis bold">preponderance of evidence</strong>. However, in <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=4053038751252355308&amp;q=Apprendi+v.+New+Jersey&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2,5"><em class="emphasis">Apprendi v. New Jersey</em></a>, 530 U.S. 466 (2000), the US Supreme Court held that the right to a jury trial prohibits judges from enhancing criminal sentences beyond the statutory maximum based on facts not determined by a jury <strong class="emphasis bold">beyond a reasonable doubt</strong>. In <em class="emphasis">Apprendi</em>, the trial court enhanced the defendant’s sentence beyond the statutory maximum for possession of a firearm with an unlawful purpose under New Jersey’s hate crimes statute. Although the jury did not determine that the defendant’s crime was a hate crime, the judge accepted new evidence at sentencing that indicated the defendant’s shooting into a residence was racially motivated. The US Supreme Court reversed the New Jersey Supreme Court, which upheld the sentencing procedure. The Court held that <em class="emphasis">other than evidence of a prior conviction</em>, a judge cannot enhance a defendant’s sentence beyond the statutory maximum unless there has been a factual determination by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt of the facts supporting the sentencing enhancement. The Court based its holding on the Sixth Amendment right to a jury trial as incorporated and applied to the states through the Fourteenth Amendment due process clause.</p>

In <em class="emphasis">Booker</em>, a federal judge enhanced a sentence following mandatory US Sentencing Guidelines, which permitted judges to find the sentencing enhancement facts using the preponderance of evidence standard. The US Supreme Court ruled that the enhancement was invalid under the Sixth Amendment right to a jury trial and held that the US Sentencing Guidelines would be <em class="emphasis">advisory</em> only, never mandatory. <em class="emphasis">Booker</em> was based on <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=16163203473167624369&amp;q=Blakely+v.+Washington&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2,5"><em class="emphasis">Blakely v.

                <p class="para editable block" id="storm_1.0-ch03_s06_s03_s01_s02_p01">Ross is tried and convicted by a jury of simple kidnapping. The maximum sentence for simple kidnapping is five years. At Ross’s sentencing hearing, the judge hears testimony from Ross’s kidnapping victim about the physical and mental torture Ross inflicted during the kidnapping. The victim did not testify at trial. The judge finds that the victim’s testimony is credible and rules that Ross used cruelty during the kidnapping by a <strong class="emphasis bold">preponderance of evidence</strong>. The judge thereafter enhances Ross’s sentence to eight years, based on a statutory sentencing enhancement of three years for “deliberate cruelty inflicted during the commission of a crime.” The three-year sentencing enhancement is most likely unconstitutional. Under the Sixth Amendment right to a jury trial, the jury must find deliberate cruelty <strong class="emphasis bold">beyond a reasonable doubt</strong>. A court can strike the enhancement of three years on appeal, and on remand, the trial court cannot increase the sentence beyond the five-year maximum.</p>
