Under the Model Penal Code, consent is ineffective if “it is given by a person who is legally incompetent to authorize the conduct…it is given by a person who by reason of youth, mental disease or defect or intoxication is manifestly unable to make a reasonable judgment…it is induced by force, duress or deception” (Model Penal Code § 2.11(3)).

            <p class="para editable block" id="storm_1.0-ch05_s05_s01_s01_p01">Gina drinks six glasses of wine at a party and offers to be the “donkey” in a game of pin the tail on the donkey. Other party members watch as Gina staggers her way to the front of the room and poses in front of the pin the tail on the donkey poster. Geoff walks up to Gina and stabs her several times in the buttocks with a pin. Geoff probably cannot claim consent as a defense to battery in this case. Gina consented to battery while she was intoxicated, and clearly she was unable to make a reasonable judgment. Thus her consent was not given <strong class="emphasis bold">knowingly</strong> and was ineffective in this situation.</p>

Geoff tells Gina he will poke out her eye with a pin if she does not volunteer to be the donkey in the pin the tail on the donkey game. He exemplifies his threat by making stabbing gestures at Gina’s eye with the pin. Frightened, Gina goes to the front of the room and poses in front of the donkey poster until Geoff stabs her in the buttocks with the pin. Geoff probably cannot claim <strong class="emphasis bold">consent</strong> as a defense to battery in this case. Gina consented in response to Geoff’s threat of physical harm. Thus her consent was not given <strong class="emphasis bold">voluntarily</strong> and was ineffective in this situation.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="storm_1.0-ch05_s05_s02_p01">Consent is a defense to only a few crimes. In most jurisdictions, consent can operate only as a defense to <em class="emphasis">sexual</em> conduct, injury that occurs during a <em class="emphasis">sporting</em> event, and crimes that do not result in <em class="emphasis">serious bodily injury</em> or <em class="emphasis">death</em>.<span class="footnote" id="storm_1.0-fn05_040">Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. 17-A § 109, accessed November 23, 2010, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.mainelegislature.org/legis/statutes/17-A/title17-Asec109.html">http://www.mainelegislature.org/legis/statutes/17-A/title17-Asec109.html</a>.</span> As the Model Penal Code states, “[w]hen conduct is charged to constitute an offense because it causes or threatens bodily harm, consent to such conduct or to the infliction of such harm is a defense if: (a) the bodily harm consented to or threatened by the conduct consented to is not serious; or (b) the conduct and the harm are reasonably foreseeable hazards of joint participation in a lawful athletic contest or competitive sport” (Model Penal Code § 2.11(2)).</p>

Change the examples, and imagine that Gina did not consume any alcohol and was not threatened by Geoff. If Gina offers to be the donkey in the pin the tail on the donkey game and Geoff stabs her in the buttocks with the pin, Geoff may be able to use consent as a defense to battery. Gina’s consent appears to be <strong class="emphasis bold">knowing</strong> and <strong class="emphasis bold">voluntary</strong>.

                    <li>Read <em class="emphasis">Donaldson v. Lungren</em>, 2 Cal. App. 4th 1614 (1992). In <em class="emphasis">Donaldson</em>, the defendant sought court permission to be cryogenically frozen because he had a brain tumor and wanted to be frozen until there was a cure. The defendant also sought to protect the individual who was going to help with the process and filed a lawsuit seeking an injunction and immunity from criminal prosecution for <strong class="emphasis bold">assisted suicide</strong>. The defendant claimed he had a constitutional right to <strong class="emphasis bold">consent</strong> to this procedure. Did the Court of Appeals of California uphold the defendant’s right to be frozen—that is, to commit suicide?
