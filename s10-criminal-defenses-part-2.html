However, the insanity defense is rarely used and hardly ever successful. This is generally because of the difficulty in proving <em class="emphasis">legal</em> insanity.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="storm_1.0-ch06_s01_p03">Many criminal defendants suffer from mental illness and can produce evidence of this illness such as psychiatric or layperson testimony. Often, mental disturbance is apparent from the defendant’s conduct under the circumstances. However, legal insanity differs from <em class="emphasis">medical</em> insanity and is generally much more difficult to establish. The rationale behind creating a different standard for legal insanity is the goal of a criminal prosecution discussed in <a class="xref" href="storm_1.0-ch01#storm_1.0-ch01">Chapter 1 "Introduction to Criminal Law"</a>. Criminal prosecution should deter as well as incapacitate. While the purpose of a medical diagnosis is to eventually <em class="emphasis">cure</em> the defendant’s disorder, the purpose of criminal law is to <em class="emphasis">punish</em> the defendant. Thus the defendant’s conduct is not excused if the defendant or society can benefit from punishment.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="storm_1.0-ch06_s01_p04">The policy supporting the insanity defense is twofold. First, an insane defendant does not have <em class="emphasis">control</em> over his or her conduct. This is similar to a defendant who is hypnotized, or sleepwalking. Second, an insane defendant does not have the ability to <em class="emphasis">form criminal intent</em>. Without the ability to control conduct, or the understanding that conduct is evil or wrong by society’s standards, an insane defendant presumably will commit crimes again and again. Thus no deterrent effect is served by punishment, and treatment for the mental defect is the appropriate remedy.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="storm_1.0-ch06_s01_p05">Four variations of the insanity defense currently exist: M’Naghten, irresistible impulse, substantial capacity, and Durham.</p>

Also called the right-wrong test.</span></span>, also called the <strong class="emphasis bold">right-wrong test</strong>, is the most common insanity defense in the United States. It is also the oldest and was created in England in 1843. The defense is named after Daniel M’Naghten. M’Naghten was under the paranoid delusion that the Prime Minister of England, Sir Robert Peel, was trying to kill him. When he tried to shoot Sir Peel from behind, he inadvertently shot Sir Peel’s Secretary, Edward Drummond, who thereafter died. M’Naghten was put on trial for murder and, to the shock of the nation, the jury found him not guilty by reason of insanity.<span class="footnote" id="storm_1.0-fn06_003"><em class="emphasis">Queen v.

        <p class="para editable block" id="storm_1.0-ch06_s01_s01_p02">The M’Naghten insanity defense is <em class="emphasis">cognitive</em> and focuses on the defendant’s awareness, rather than the ability to <em class="emphasis">control</em> conduct. The defense requires two elements. First, the defendant must be suffering from a <em class="emphasis">mental defect</em> at the time he or she commits the criminal act. The mental defect can be called a “defect of reason” or a “disease of the mind,” depending on the jurisdiction.<span class="footnote" id="storm_1.0-fn06_004">Iowa Code § 701.4, accessed November 30, 2010, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://coolice.legis.state.ia.us/cool-ice/default.asp?category=billinfo&amp;service=iowacode&amp;ga=83&amp;input=701">http://coolice.legis.state.ia.us/cool-ice/default.asp?category=billinfo&amp;service=iowacode&amp;ga=83&amp;input=701</a>.</span> Second, the trier of fact must find that because of the mental defect, the defendant did not know either the <em class="emphasis">nature and quality</em> of the criminal act or that the act was <em class="emphasis">wrong</em>.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="storm_1.0-ch06_s01_s01_p03">The terms “defect of reason” and “disease of the mind” can be defined in different ways, but in general, the defendant must be cognitively impaired to the level of not knowing the nature and quality of the criminal act, or that the act is wrong. Some common examples of mental defects and diseases are psychosis, schizophrenia, and paranoia.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="storm_1.0-ch06_s01_s01_p04">Jurisdictions vary as to the level of awareness the defendant must possess.

If appreciate is the standard, the trier of fact must analyze the defendant’s emotional state, and evidence of the defendant’s character or personality may be relevant and admissible.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="storm_1.0-ch06_s01_s01_p05">A defendant does not know the nature and quality of a criminal act if the defendant is completely oblivious to what he or she is doing. This is quite rare, so most defendants claiming insanity choose to assert that they did not know their act was <em class="emphasis">wrong</em>.

        <p class="para editable block" id="storm_1.0-ch06_s01_s03_p02">The substantial capacity test is as follows: “A person is not responsible for criminal conduct if at the time of such conduct as a result of mental disease or defect he lacks substantial capacity either to appreciate the criminality [wrongfulness] of his conduct or to conform his conduct to the requirements of law” (Model Penal Code § 4.01(1)). The defense has two elements. The first element requires the defendant to have a mental disease or defect, like the M’Naghten and irresistible impulse insanity defenses. The second element combines the <strong class="emphasis bold">cognitive</strong> standard with <strong class="emphasis bold">volitional</strong>, like the irresistible impulse insanity defense supplementing the M’Naghten insanity defense.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="storm_1.0-ch06_s01_s03_p03">In general, it is easier to establish insanity under the substantial capacity test because both the cognitive and volitional requirements are scaled down to more flexible standards. Unlike the M’Naghten insanity defense, the substantial capacity test relaxes the requirement for complete inability to understand or know the difference between right and wrong. Instead, the defendant must lack <em class="emphasis">substantial</em>, not total, capacity. The “wrong” in the substantial capacity test is “criminality,” which is a <em class="emphasis">legal</em> rather than moral wrong. In addition, unlike the irresistible impulse insanity defense, the defendant must lack <em class="emphasis">substantial</em>, not total, ability to conform conduct to the requirements of the law. Another difference in the substantial capacity test is the use of the word “appreciate” rather than “know.” As stated previously, appreciate incorporates an emotional quality, which means that evidence of the defendant’s character or personality is relevant and most likely admissible to support the defense.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="storm_1.0-ch06_s01_s03_s01_p01">Loreen has been diagnosed with psychosis and spent most of her life in a mental hospital. While at the mental hospital, Loreen made friends with many of the patients and health-care personnel. From time to time, Loreen would play jokes on these friends. Most of these “jokes” consisted of putting her antidepressants into their food. Loreen was always reprimanded and often sternly punished for these escapades. After her release from the mental hospital at age twenty-one, Loreen falls in love with Aidan, a man who works in a bookstore near her apartment. Loreen decides to make Aidan fall in love with her by feeding him a magic potion, which she concocts out of a mixture of her antidepressants. Loreen buys a book from Aidan and casually asks if he would like her to buy him a coffee. Aidan shrugs and says, “Sure, but I don’t have a break for another two hours.” Loreen offers to bring him the coffee. Before bringing the drink to Aidan, she puts her “magic potion” in it. While Aidan is sipping the coffee, Loreen declares her love for him. She then states, “I know I shouldn’t have, but I put a love potion in your coffee. I hope it doesn’t hurt you.” Aidan becomes seriously ill after drinking the coffee and is hospitalized.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="storm_1.0-ch06_s01_s03_s01_p02">Loreen claims she is not guilty for battering Aidan by reason of insanity. If Loreen is in a jurisdiction that recognizes the substantial capacity test, she may be successful with her claim. Loreen has a mental disease or defect, <strong class="emphasis bold">psychosis</strong>. Loreen’s statement to Aidan indicates that she lacks the <em class="emphasis">substantial</em> capacity to appreciate the criminality of her conduct. Note that if Loreen were in a M’Naghten jurisdiction, her statement “I know I shouldn’t have” could prove her awareness that her conduct was <em class="emphasis">wrong</em>, defeating her claim. In addition, Loreen’s behavior at the mental hospital indicates that she lacks the substantial capacity to conform or control her conduct. Even after a lifetime of being punished over and over for mixing her meds together and putting them in other people’s food or drink, Loreen still does it. Lastly, in a substantial capacity jurisdiction, testimony from Loreen’s friends at the mental hospital may be admissible to support her claim of insanity, and her lack of ability to “appreciate” the criminality of her conduct.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="storm_1.0-ch06_s01_s04_p02">In general, the Durham insanity defense relies on ordinary principles of <strong class="emphasis bold">proximate causation</strong>.

Most psychiatric experts agree that individuals afflicted with paranoia unreasonably believe that the human population is “out to get them.” Arianna works under the direct supervision of Nora, who has a physical condition called “walleye.” Nora’s walleye makes it appear that she is looking to the side when she addresses people. Arianna gradually becomes convinced that Nora is communicating secret messages to their coworkers when she is speaking to Arianna. Arianna is genuinely frightened that Nora is telling their coworkers to kill her, and she decides she needs to defend herself. Arianna brings a gun to work one day, and when Nora begins talking to her about her tendency to take overlong lunches, Arianna pulls the gun out of her cubicle and shoots and kills Nora.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="storm_1.0-ch06_s01_s04_s01_p02">Arianna claims she is not guilty for killing Nora by reason of insanity.

Arianna can probably produce evidence, such as psychiatric expert testimony, that her paranoia “caused” or “produced” her criminal conduct, which was shooting Nora.

If the defendant is mentally incompetent to stand trial, the trial is delayed until the defendant regains competency. Although a detailed discussion of mental competence to stand trial is beyond the scope of this book, in general, a criminal defendant must be able to understand the charges against him or her, and be able to assist in his or her defense. As the Model Penal Code provides, “[n]o person who as a result of mental disease or defect lacks capacity to understand the proceedings against him or to assist in his own defense shall be tried, convicted or sentenced for the commission of an offense so long as such incapacity endures” (Model Penal Code § 4.04).

                    <li>The four states that do not recognize the insanity defense are Montana, Utah, Kansas, and Idaho.</li>
                    <li>The four versions of the insanity defense are M’Naghten, irresistible impulse, substantial capacity, and Durham.</li>
                    <li>
                        <p class="para">The two elements of the M’Naghten insanity defense are the following:</p>
                        <ul class="itemizedlist" id="storm_1.0-ch06_s01_s10_s01_l02">
                            <li>The defendant must be suffering from a mental defect or disease at the time of the crime.</li>
                            <li>The defendant did not know the nature or quality of the criminal act he or she committed or that the act was wrong because of the mental defect or disease.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p class="para">The two elements of the irresistible impulse insanity defense are the following:</p>
                        <ul class="itemizedlist" id="storm_1.0-ch06_s01_s10_s01_l03">
                            <li>The defendant must be suffering from a mental defect or disease at the time of the crime.</li>
                            <li>The defendant could not control his or her criminal conduct because of the mental defect or disease.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>The substantial capacity test softens the second element of the M’Naghten and irresistible impulse insanity defenses. Under the substantial capacity test, the defendant must lack substantial, not total, capacity to appreciate the criminality of conduct or to control or conform conduct to the law.</li>
                    <li>The Durham insanity defense excuses criminal conduct when it is caused by a mental disease or defect.</li>
                    <li>The criminal defendant pleading not guilty by reason of insanity must produce evidence to rebut the presumption that criminal defendants are sane. Thereafter, either the prosecution has the burden of disproving insanity to a certain evidentiary standard or the defendant has the burden of proving insanity to a preponderance of evidence or clear and convincing evidence.</li>
                    <li>The diminished capacity defense is a failure of proof imperfect defense that may reduce a first-degree murder to second-degree murder or manslaughter if the defendant did not have the mental capacity to form first-degree murder criminal intent. The insanity defense is generally a perfect affirmative defense in many jurisdictions.</li>
                    <li>The insanity defense exonerates the defendant from criminal responsibility. Mental incompetence to stand trial delays the criminal trial until mental competency is regained.</li>
                    <li>The guilty but mentally ill verdict finds the criminal defendant guilty but orders him or her to undergo mental health treatment while incarcerated. The insanity defense is generally a perfect affirmative defense in many jurisdictions.</li>
                    <li>The federal government and some states automatically commit a criminal defendant to a mental health facility after an acquittal based on insanity. Other states have a postverdict hearing to rule on commitment.</li>
                    <li>A claim of temporary insanity is the same as a claim of insanity except for the duration of the mental illness.</li>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Infancy</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="storm_1.0-ch06_s02_s01_p01">Many states recognize the defense of <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">infancy</a><span class="glossdef">A defense that asserts the defendant is too young to form the requisite intent for the crime.</span></span>. <strong class="emphasis bold">Infancy</strong> asserts that the defendant is not subject to criminal prosecution because he or she is <em class="emphasis">too young</em> to commit a crime. The policy supporting the infancy defense is the belief that juvenile defendants are too immature to form criminal intent. The infancy defense is typically statutory and can be perfect or imperfect, depending on the jurisdiction.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="storm_1.0-ch06_s02_s01_p02">States divide up the jurisdiction of criminal defendants between juvenile courts and adult courts. Juvenile court systems generally retain jurisdiction over criminal defendants under the age of sixteen, seventeen, or eighteen, with exceptions. The Model Penal Code position is that “[a] person shall not be tried for or convicted of an offense if: (a) at the time of the conduct charged to constitute the offense he was less than sixteen years of age, [in which case the Juvenile Court shall have exclusive jurisdiction]” (Model Penal Code § 4.10(1)(a)).</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="storm_1.0-ch06_s02_s01_p03">The primary purpose of a juvenile court adjudication is <strong class="emphasis bold">rehabilitation</strong>. The goal is to reform the minor before he or she becomes an adult. In most states, the infancy defense protects a youthful defendant from criminal prosecution as an <em class="emphasis">adult</em>; it does not prohibit a juvenile adjudication. Most minor defendants are adjudicated in juvenile court, so the infancy defense is rarely used.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="storm_1.0-ch06_s02_s01_p04">Juveniles <em class="emphasis">can</em> be prosecuted as adults under certain specified circumstances. At early common law, criminal defendants were divided into three age groups. Those under the age of seven were deemed incapable of forming criminal intent, and could not be criminally prosecuted. Defendants between the ages of seven and fourteen were provided a <strong class="emphasis bold">rebuttable presumption</strong> that they lacked the mental capacity to form criminal intent. Once a defendant turned fourteen, he or she was subject to an adult criminal prosecution. Modern <em class="emphasis">statutes</em> codify the adult criminal prosecution standard for different age groups. Some states follow the early common law and set up rebuttable and irrebuttable presumptions based on the defendant’s age.<span class="footnote" id="storm_1.0-fn06_035">RCW 9A.04.050, accessed December 6, 2010, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://apps.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=9A.04.050">http://apps.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=9A.04.050</a>.</span> Other states set forth a minimum age, such as fourteen or sixteen, and defendants who have reached that age are prosecuted as adults.<span class="footnote" id="storm_1.0-fn06_036">N.Y.

        <p class="para editable block" id="storm_1.0-ch06_s02_s01_p05">When a juvenile court has jurisdiction, the jurisdiction must be forfeited if the juvenile is to be prosecuted as an adult.

Mario can probably claim <strong class="emphasis bold">infancy</strong> as a perfect defense to the theft charge. Mario should be adjudicated in juvenile court, not prosecuted as an adult.

        <p class="para editable block" id="storm_1.0-ch06_s03_s01_p01">It is entrapment pursuant to the subjective entrapment defense when law enforcement pressures the defendant to commit the crime against his or her will. The subjective entrapment test focuses on the <em class="emphasis">defendant’s</em> individual characteristics more than on law enforcement’s behavior. If the facts indicate that the defendant is <em class="emphasis">predisposed</em> to commit the crime without law enforcement pressure, the defendant will not prevail on the defense.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="storm_1.0-ch06_s03_s01_p02">The defendant’s criminal record is admissible if relevant to prove the defendant’s criminal nature and predisposition. Generally, law enforcement can furnish criminal opportunities and use decoys and feigned accomplices without crossing the line into subjective entrapment. However, if it is clear that the requisite intent for the offense originated <em class="emphasis">with law enforcement</em>, not the <em class="emphasis">defendant</em>, the defendant can assert subjective entrapment as a defense.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="storm_1.0-ch06_s03_s01_s01_p01">Winifred regularly attends Narcotics Anonymous (NA) for her heroin addiction. All the NA attendees know that Winifred is a dedicated member who has been clean for ten years, Marcus, a law enforcement decoy, meets Winifred at one of the meetings and begs her to “hook him up” with some heroin. Winifred refuses. Marcus attends the next meeting, and follows Winifred out to her car pleading with her to get him some heroin. After listening to Marcus explain his physical symptoms of withdrawal in detail, Winifred feels pity and promises to help Marcus out. She agrees to meet Marcus in two hours with the heroin. When Winifred and Marcus meet at the designated location, Marcus arrests Winifred for sale of narcotics. Winifred may be able to assert entrapment as a defense if her state recognizes the <strong class="emphasis bold">subjective entrapment defense</strong>. Winifred has not used drugs for ten years and did not initiate contact with law enforcement. It is unlikely that the intent to sell heroin <em class="emphasis">originated</em> with Winifred because she has been a dedicated member of NA, and she actually met Marcus at an NA meeting while trying to maintain her sobriety. Thus it appears that Marcus <em class="emphasis">pressured</em> Winifred to sell heroin against a natural <em class="emphasis">predisposition</em>, and the entrapment defense may excuse her conduct.</p>

        <h3 class="title">Summary</h3>
        <p class="para" id="storm_1.0-ch06_s04_p01">The federal government and every state except Montana, Utah, Kansas, and Idaho recognize the insanity defense. A not guilty by reason of insanity verdict is an acquittal for the offense. The policy supporting the insanity defense is the lack of deterrent effect when punishing the legally insane. Four insanity defenses are recognized in the United States: M’Naghten, irresistible impulse, substantial capacity, and Durham. The M’Naghten insanity defense is cognitive and excuses criminal conduct when the defendant is suffering from a mental defect or disease that prevents the defendant from knowing the nature or quality of conduct or from knowing that conduct is wrong. The irresistible impulse insanity defense adds a volitional component and excuses conduct the defendant cannot control because of a mental defect or disease. The substantial capacity test was created by the Model Penal Code and softens the requirements to substantial, rather than total, capacity to appreciate the criminality of conduct or to conform conduct to the law. The Durham insanity defense is recognized only in New Hampshire, and excuses conduct that is the product of or caused by a mental disease or defect. Jurisdictions vary as to the burden of proving insanity. All jurisdictions require the defendant to rebut a presumption that he or she is sane; some also require the defendant to persuade the trier of fact that he or she is legally insane to a preponderance of evidence or clear and convincing evidence (which is a higher standard than preponderance of evidence).</p>
        <p class="para" id="storm_1.0-ch06_s04_p02">A minority of jurisdictions recognizes diminished capacity and the syndrome defense when the defendant cannot form the requisite criminal intent for the offense because of a mental impairment. The criminal defendant must also be mentally competent to stand trial, which means the defendant can understand the charges brought against him or her and can assist in any defense. Some jurisdictions recognize a guilty but mentally ill verdict, which does not exonerate the defendant, but provides for mental health treatment while incarcerated. Temporary insanity is also a defense in some jurisdictions and does not differ from the insanity defense except for the duration of the mental defect or disease.</p>
        <p class="para" id="storm_1.0-ch06_s04_p03">The infancy defense excuses conduct when the defendant is too young to form criminal intent for the offense. The infancy defense is generally not available in juvenile adjudications, so it is rarely asserted because most youthful defendants are under the jurisdiction of juvenile courts. Juvenile courts can waive this jurisdiction and allow for an adult criminal prosecution under certain circumstances, considering the criteria of the nature of the offense, the sophistication it requires, the defendant’s prior criminal history, and the threat the defendant poses to public safety.</p>
        <p class="para" id="storm_1.0-ch06_s04_p04">Other excuse defenses are intoxication, ignorance, and mistake. Voluntary intoxication is frowned on as a defense, but will occasionally excuse conduct if it negates certain high-level criminal intent requirements. Involuntary intoxication, which is intoxication achieved unknowingly, or under duress or fraud, is more likely to provide a defense if it affects the defendant’s capacity to form criminal intent. Ignorance of the law is not a defense because individuals are expected to know the laws of their jurisdiction. Mistake of law, which means the defendant does not know conduct is illegal, functions as a defense if the mistake is based on a judicial opinion or statute that is later overturned. Mistake of law is not a defense if the mistake is rooted in incorrect legal advice from an attorney. Mistake of fact is a defense if the facts as the defendant believes them to be negate the intent required for the offense.</p>
        <p class="para" id="storm_1.0-ch06_s04_p05">Entrapment is also a defense in every jurisdiction. Most states and the federal government recognize the subjective entrapment defense, which focuses on the defendant’s predisposition, and does not excuse conduct if the defendant would have committed the crime without law enforcement pressure. In a subjective entrapment jurisdiction, the defendant’s criminal record is admissible to prove predisposition to commit the crime at issue. Objective entrapment is the Model Penal Code approach and excuses conduct if the pressure by law enforcement would induce a reasonable, law-abiding person to commit the crime. The defendant’s criminal record is not admissible to show predisposition in an objective entrapment jurisdiction because the focus is on law enforcement tactics, not the defendant’s nature.</p>

The defendant wants to claim that his diagnosed paranoid schizophrenia affected his ability to form the intent required for murder. In your state (Arizona), the defendant cannot introduce this argument to negate intent; he can only plead insanity under an abbreviated version of M’Naghten, which requires proof that the defendant did not know his conduct was wrong because of a mental defect or disease.

            <li>The defendant and a narcotics decoy have been acquainted for several years. The narcotics decoy set up a sale transaction between the defendant and a police officer, the defendant made the sale, and was thereafter charged with delivery of a controlled substance.

        <ol class="orderedlist" id="storm_1.0-ch06_s04_l06">
            <li>Jeffrey will not be successful in a jurisdiction that recognizes the <strong class="emphasis bold">M’Naghten</strong> insanity defense. Although Jeffrey has a mental defect or disease, schizophrenia, Jeffrey’s behavior in <em class="emphasis">hiding</em> the victims’ corpses indicates that he knows his behavior is <strong class="emphasis bold">wrong</strong>. Thus Jeffrey cannot produce evidence establishing the second element of M’Naghten.</li>
            <li>The New Jersey Supreme Court reversed the defendant’s conviction, holding that the experts changed their opinion after being educated as to the <em class="emphasis">meaning</em> of mental defect or disease under M’Naghten. Thus the change by the experts was not fraudulent and the defendant was entitled to a retrial.</li>
            <li>The Supreme Court of South Carolina upheld the convictions and the statute. The court held that the statute rationally accomplishes its goals, and guilty but mentally ill defendants receive <em class="emphasis">immediate</em> rather than <em class="emphasis">delayed</em> treatment, which complies with due process.</li>

        <ol class="orderedlist" id="storm_1.0-ch06_s04_l07">
            <li>It is unlikely that the judge will waive juvenile court jurisdiction in this case. Some of the criteria a judge will analyze when waiving jurisdiction are the nature of the offense, the sophistication it requires, the defendant’s criminal history, and the threat the defendant poses to public safety. This is Burt’s <em class="emphasis">first offense</em>, and it did not involve violence or require much sophistication. Thus the judge will probably allow Burt to be adjudicated in juvenile court.</li>
            <li>The Court of Appeals of the State of New York upheld the defendant’s conviction and the trial court’s refusal to instruct the jury on intoxication. The court based its holding on the depraved mind murder statute, which requires <strong class="emphasis bold">reckless</strong> criminal intent, and the intoxication defense statute, which <em class="emphasis">disallows</em> evidence of intoxication as a defense to a reckless intent crime.</li>
            <li>The Court of Appeals of Maryland upheld the trial court’s decision to disallow the mistake of age defense. The court based its holding on the plain meaning of the statutory rape statute, which is a <strong class="emphasis bold">strict liability</strong> offense.</li>

        <p class="simpara">From <a class="xref" href="storm_1.0-ch06_s03#storm_1.0-ch06_s03">Section 6.3 "Entrapment"</a></p>
        <ol class="orderedlist" id="storm_1.0-ch06_s04_l08">
            <li>Allen’s criminal record for burglary is not admissible to prove his predisposition to commit the crime of purchasing contraband. The fact that Allen committed a burglary in the past does <em class="emphasis">not</em> indicate that he is <em class="emphasis">predisposed</em> to purchase contraband. Thus Allen’s criminal record for burglary is irrelevant and inadmissible, even though he is claiming entrapment in a jurisdiction that recognizes the <strong class="emphasis bold">subjective entrapment</strong> defense.</li>
            <li>The US Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit affirmed the district court’s denial of the petition. The court held that the defendant did not have a <em class="emphasis">constitutional</em> right to assert entrapment and that the rejection of the defendant’s sentencing entrapment claim was appropriate, albeit unfortunate, under the circumstances.</li>
            <li>The Court of Appeal of Florida reversed the defendant’s conviction under both theories of entrapment. The court based its holding on the defendant’s lack of <em class="emphasis">predisposition</em> to commit the crime and the government’s assurance that there would be no governmental interference, which was <em class="emphasis">false</em> under the circumstances.</li>

            <li>Whether Mitchell is put on trial, or held indefinitely because of his mental incompetency, he is <strong class="emphasis bold">incapacitated</strong> and prevented from harming other victims. The difference is <strong class="emphasis bold">retribution</strong>. The federal judge permitted Mitchell to be put on trial, which resulted in a conviction providing retribution. Barzee’s sentencing also provided retribution. The state court judge allowed only for the <strong class="emphasis bold">incapacitation</strong> of Mitchell, which did not resolve the case for the Smart family or the general public. Whether or not retribution is ethical has been debated for centuries. However, retribution does restore public confidence in the judicial system, which can have a <em class="emphasis">positive deterrent</em> effect.</li>

        <ol class="orderedlist" id="storm_1.0-ch06_s04_l10">
            <li>In this case, the US Supreme Court upheld Arizona’s abbreviated M’Naghten statute, and also confirmed Arizona’s constitutional right to <em class="emphasis">preclude</em> a defense based on the defendant’s inability to form criminal intent because of a mental defect or disease. Thus you would not be able to strike down Arizona’s insanity defense statute, and you could not introduce evidence that the defendant lacked the capacity to form criminal intent, so you should <strong class="emphasis bold">reject</strong> the case.</li>
            <li>The Washington Supreme Court upheld the trial court’s ruling that the defendant was incapable of forming the intent to commit rape of a child, reversing the appellate court. The court based its holding on the Washington infancy statute, which requires the prosecution to rebut a presumption of infancy for defendants under the age of twelve by clear and convincing evidence. Thus you would prevail on the infancy defense, and you should <strong class="emphasis bold">accept</strong> the case.</li>
            <li>In this case, the trial court rejected the defendant’s involuntary intoxication claim, and the defendant had to plead <strong class="emphasis bold">not guilty by reason of insanity</strong>. He was thereafter found guilty. On appeal, the Court of Appeals of Colorado <em class="emphasis">reversed</em>, holding that the defendant had the right to claim intoxication and present evidence of this claim to the trier of fact. Thus you would be able to assert intoxication as a defense, and should <strong class="emphasis bold">accept</strong> the case.</li>
            <li>The Court of Appeals of Texas upheld the trial court’s rejection of a motion to dismiss the charge based on <em class="emphasis">entrapment</em>. The court held that friendship and numerous phone calls are not enough to pressure an unwilling person to commit a crime. Thus you would lose on the entrapment defense and should <strong class="emphasis bold">reject</strong> the case.</li>
