                <p class="para editable block" id="storm_1.0-ch09_s03_s01_s01_s02_p01">Imagine that Joannie and her husband Tim are in a terrible fight in the kitchen. Tim tells Joannie that he is going to get a divorce and will thereafter seek full custody of their two young children. Joannie states, “Wait here. I need to go to the bathroom. I will be right back.” She walks down the hall, but goes into the <em class="emphasis">bedroom</em>, rather than the bathroom, and removes a handgun from the nightstand drawer. She then walks to the bathroom and flushes the toilet. Hiding the handgun in the pocket of her bathrobe, she walks back into the kitchen, removes it, and shoots Tim four times in the abdomen, killing him.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="storm_1.0-ch09_s03_s01_s01_s02_p02">In this scenario, Joannie probably could be convicted of premeditated murder in most jurisdictions. Joannie shoots and kills Tim in a calm, methodical manner, evidencing <strong class="emphasis bold">deliberation</strong>. Her manufactured excuse and flushing of the toilet indicate <strong class="emphasis bold">planning</strong>. The act of shooting Tim four times shows that Joannie has a <strong class="emphasis bold">specific intent to kill</strong> and a strong and calculated desire to bring about Tim’s death. Note that <em class="emphasis">timing</em> is not an issue here. Even a few minutes are enough to carry out a premeditated murder if the proper facts are present.</p>

                <p class="para editable block" id="storm_1.0-ch09_s03_s01_s01_s03_p01">Compare the previous example with this scenario. Frank, Dillon’s supervisor, calls Dillon into his office and fires him. Enraged, Dillon grabs a heavy brass paperweight from the top of Frank’s desk and strikes him in the forehead, killing him instantly. In this example, Dillon acts in <em class="emphasis">anger</em>, not calm, cool, reflection. The act of grabbing a heavy brass paperweight appears <em class="emphasis">impulsive</em>, not planned. There is no evidence to indicate that Dillon knew he would be fired or knew that there was a brass paperweight on Frank’s desk. In addition, the single blow to the head does not necessarily indicate that Dillon had a strong and calculated desire to <em class="emphasis">kill</em> Frank. Dillon’s conduct may be supported by <strong class="emphasis bold">murder intent</strong> (most likely implied malice, knowingly, or recklessly under circumstances manifesting extreme indifference to the value of human life), but there is no evidence of specific intent to kill, deliberation, or premeditation. Thus Frank’s killing would probably not be first-degree premeditated murder in most jurisdictions.</p>

                    <li>Most states and the federal government include premeditated murder, murder by a specified means, and felony murder in their first-degree murder statutes.</li>
                    <li>Premeditated murder is typically a purposeful killing committed after calm planning and reflection. An extensive length of time between the formation of criminal intent and the criminal act is not generally a requirement of premeditated murder.</li>
                    <li>The criminal act can help prove that a murder was premeditated. If the killing is carried out in a manner that indicates a strong and calculated desire to bring about the victim’s death, the trier of fact can conclude that the murder was premeditated.</li>
                    <li>When the defendant commits murder with a particularly heinous method, the killing is murder by a specified means.</li>
                    <li>First-degree murder statutes often include the following specified means: murder by drive-by shooting, destructive device like a bomb, weapon of mass destruction, ammunition designed to puncture a bulletproof vest, poison, torture, or lying in wait.</li>
                    <li>First-degree murder is the highest classification of murder with the most severe sentencing options. If the jurisdiction allows for capital punishment, first-degree murder typically is the only crime against an individual that merits the death penalty. If the jurisdiction does not allow for capital punishment, first-degree murder often qualifies the defendant for life in prison.</li>
                    <li>The only crime against an individual that can merit capital punishment is criminal homicide. In most jurisdictions, the defendant must commit first-degree murder combined with one or more aggravating factors that are not outweighed by mitigating factors to receive the death penalty.</li>

                    <li>Johnnie decides he wants to kill Marcus, the leader of a rival gang. Johnnie knows that Marcus always hangs out in front of the gas station on Friday nights. Johnnie puts his gun in the glove compartment of his car and drives to the gas station on a Friday night. He sees Marcus standing out front. He slowly drives by, takes aim, and shoots Marcus from the car, killing him. Could this be first-degree murder? Explain your answer.</li>
                    <li>Read <em class="emphasis">State v. West</em>, 844 S.W.2d 144 (1992). Did the Supreme Court of Tennessee hold that a defendant’s failure to report a shooting to the police for over an hour and concealment of the murder weapon constitutes sufficient evidence to prove premeditated murder? The case is available at this link: <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=3481778471457660977&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2002&amp;as_vis=1">http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=3481778471457660977&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2002&amp;as_vis=1</a>.</li>
                    <li>Read <em class="emphasis">U.S. v. Downs</em>, 56 F.3d 973 (1995). Identify motive, planning, and preconceived design in this case.
