        <p class="para editable block" id="storm_1.0-ch09_s04_s01_p01">What distinguishes felony murder from murder is the absence of the typical <strong class="emphasis bold">murder</strong> intent.

            <p class="para editable block" id="storm_1.0-ch09_s04_s01_s01_p01">When the defendant commits a felony that is inherently dangerous to life, he or she does so knowing that some innocent victim may die. In essence, this awareness is similar to implied malice, knowingly, or recklessly under circumstances manifesting extreme indifference to the value of human life. What is difficult to justify is a conviction for felony murder when the felony is <em class="emphasis">not</em> inherently dangerous to life. Thus most jurisdictions limit the felony murder doctrine to felonies that create a foreseeable risk of violence or death. States that include nonviolent felonies in their felony murder statutes generally grade them as <strong class="emphasis bold">second-</strong> or <strong class="emphasis bold">third-degree</strong> felony murder.<span class="footnote" id="storm_1.0-fn09_039">Fla.

            <p class="para editable block" id="storm_1.0-ch09_s04_s01_s02_p01">Joaquin, who has just lost his job, decides to burn down his apartment building because he can’t afford to pay the rent. Joaquin carefully soaks his apartment with lighter fluid, exits into the hallway, and throws a lit, lighter-fluid-soaked towel into the apartment. He then runs outside to watch the entire building burn down. Several tenants die of smoke inhalation because of the fire. In jurisdictions that recognize felony murder, Joaquin can probably be charged with and convicted of murder for every one of these deaths.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="storm_1.0-ch09_s04_s01_s02_p02">In this example, Joaquin did not <em class="emphasis">intend to kill</em> the tenants. However, he did most likely have the criminal intent necessary for <strong class="emphasis bold">arson</strong>. Therefore, felony murder convictions are appropriate. Note that Joaquin exhibited extreme indifference to whether the tenants in the building lived or died, which could also constitute the criminal intent of <strong class="emphasis bold">implied malice</strong> or <strong class="emphasis bold">depraved heart</strong>.</p>

Group participation in criminal conduct could constitute more than one crime—for example, conspiracy—and could also place criminal responsibility squarely on a defendant who did not <em class="emphasis">commit</em> the criminal act.

Joe is designated as the primary robber and is supposed to enter the bank and hand a note to the teller demanding all the money in her station. Jane’s role in the felony is to drive the getaway vehicle to the bank, wait outside the front door with the motor running, and transport Joe and the money back to their apartment after the bank transaction is completed. Joe takes a handgun hidden beneath his jacket into the bank. He passes the note to the teller, and she frantically summons a security guard. As the security guard starts to approach, Joe pulls out the gun. An elderly lady standing to the left of Joe suffers a heart attack and dies at the sight of the gun. In this case, Joe <em class="emphasis">and Jane</em> can probably be convicted of felony murder. Note that Jane did nothing to directly cause the victim’s death from a heart attack. However, Jane <em class="emphasis">did</em> drive the getaway vehicle with the criminal intent to commit robbery, so Jane is criminally responsible for the consequences in many jurisdictions.</p>

                <p class="para editable block" id="storm_1.0-ch09_s04_s02_s02_s01_p01">Review the example with Joe and Jane in <a class="xref" href="#storm_1.0-ch09_s04_s02_s01">Section 9 "Example of Co-Felon Liability for Felony Murder"</a>. Change this example so that Jane is a teller at the local bank. Joe and Jane plan the “robbery” so that Jane is to pretend Joe is a customer, and hand Joe all the money in her station after he enters the bank <em class="emphasis">unarmed</em> and passes her a phony check made out to “cash.” Without informing Jane, Joe brings a gun into the bank, “just in case.” The security guard observes Jane handing Joe large amounts of cash. Suspicious, he begins to approach the station. Joe notices and frantically pulls out the gun and points it at the security guard. The elderly lady standing to the left of Joe suffers a heart attack and dies at the sight of the gun. In this example, Jane may have a valid defense to co-felon liability for the elderly lady’s death in some jurisdictions. Although Jane had the intent to commit theft, a trier of fact could determine that Jane had neither the <em class="emphasis">knowledge</em> nor <em class="emphasis">awareness</em> that a death might occur because she believed she was cooperating in a nonviolent offense. Thus it is possible that in certain jurisdictions only Joe is subject to a conviction of felony murder in this case.</p>

                <li>The criminal intent element required for felony murder is the intent required for the underlying felony, not murder intent.</li>
                <li>If a felony is inherently dangerous to life, the defendant may act with implied malice, knowingly, or recklessly manifesting extreme indifference to human life when committing or attempting to commit the felony.</li>
                <li>If more than one defendant commits or attempts to commit a felony, all defendants are guilty of felony murder if a victim is killed during the commission or attempted commission of the felony.</li>
                <li>Some jurisdictions will not find a co-felon criminally responsible for felony murder if the co-felon did not commit the act of killing and was unaware that there was a risk of death.</li>
                <li>In some jurisdictions, all co-felons are criminally responsible for felony murder when someone other than a co-felon kills a victim during the commission or attempted commission of a felony that is inherently dangerous to life.</li>
