        <p class="para editable block" id="storm_1.0-ch05_s01_s01_p01">Defenses can be categorized as denial or failure of proof, affirmative, imperfect, or perfect. Defenses can also be categorized as factual, legal, based on justification, or excuse.

            <p class="para editable block" id="storm_1.0-ch05_s01_s01_s01_p01">As stated in <a class="xref" href="storm_1.0-ch02#storm_1.0-ch02">Chapter 2 "The Legal System in the United States"</a>, a criminal defendant will be acquitted if the prosecution cannot prove <em class="emphasis">every element</em> of the offense beyond a reasonable doubt. In certain cases, the defendant can either <em class="emphasis">deny</em> that a criminal element(s) exists or simply sit back and wait for the prosecution to fail in meeting its burden of proof. This legal strategy is sometimes referred to as either a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">denial or failure of proof defense</a><span class="glossdef">The defendant denies that an element of the offense exists and prevents the prosecution from meeting its burden of proof.</span></span>.</p>

When the defendant asserts an affirmative defense, the defendant raises a <em class="emphasis">new</em> issue that must be proven to a certain evidentiary standard. State statutes often specify whether a defense is affirmative. The Model Penal Code defines an affirmative defense as a defense that is deemed affirmative in the Code or a separate statute, or that “involves a matter of excuse or justification peculiarly within the knowledge of the defendant” (Model Penal Code § 1.12 (3) (c)). Procedurally, the defendant must assert any affirmative defense before or during the trial, or the defense cannot be used as grounds for an appeal.</p>

Some states require the defendant to meet the burden of production, but require the prosecution to thereafter meet the burden of persuasion, <em class="emphasis">disproving</em> the defense to a preponderance of evidence, or in some states, beyond a reasonable doubt. Other states require the defendant to meet the burden of production and the burden of persuasion.

                        <li>A denial or failure of proof defense focuses on the elements of the crime and prevents the prosecution from meeting its burden of proof. An affirmative defense is a defense that raises an issue separate from the elements of the crime. Most affirmative defenses are based on justification or excuse and must be raised before or during the trial to preserve the issue for appeal.</li>
                        <li>An imperfect defense reduces the severity of the offense; a perfect defense results in an acquittal.</li>
                        <li>If the basis for a defense is an issue of fact, it is called a factual defense. If the basis for a defense is an issue of law, it is called a legal defense.</li>
                        <li>An example of a factual defense is an alibi defense, which asserts that the defendant could not have committed the crime because he or she was somewhere else when the crime occurred. An example of a legal defense is a claim that the statute of limitations has expired, which asserts that it is too late for the government to prosecute the defendant for the crime.</li>
                        <li>An affirmative defense is based on justification when it claims that criminal conduct is justified under the circumstances. An affirmative defense is based on excuse when it claims that the criminal defendant should be excused for his or her conduct.</li>

                        <li>Carol is on trial for battery, a general intent crime. Carol puts on a defense that proves her conduct was accidental, <em class="emphasis">not</em> intentional. Is this an affirmative defense? Why or why not?</li>
                        <li>Read <em class="emphasis">State v. Burkhart</em>, 565 S.E.2d 298 (2002). In <em class="emphasis">Burkhart</em>, the defendant was convicted of three counts of murder. The defendant claimed he acted in self-defense. The jury instruction given during the defendant’s trial stated that the prosecution had the burden of disproving self-defense. However, the instruction did not state that the prosecution’s burden of disproving self-defense was <em class="emphasis">beyond a reasonable doubt</em>. Did the Supreme Court of South Carolina uphold the defendant’s conviction for the murders?

                        <li>Read <em class="emphasis">Hoagland v. State</em>, 240 P.3d 1043 (2010). In <em class="emphasis">Hoagland</em>, the defendant wanted to assert a <strong class="emphasis bold">necessity</strong> defense to the crime of driving while under the influence. The Nevada Legislature had never addressed or mentioned a necessity defense. Did the Supreme Court of Nevada allow the defendant to present the necessity defense?
