        <h2 class="title editable block">Consolidated Theft Statutes</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="storm_1.0-ch11_s01_s01_p01">Historically, nonviolent theft was broken down into three categories: <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">larceny</a><span class="glossdef">Theft of personal property by a physical taking.</span></span>, <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">embezzlement</a><span class="glossdef">Theft of real or personal property by conversion.</span></span>, and <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">false pretenses</a><span class="glossdef">Theft of real property, personal property, or services by a false representation of fact.</span></span>. The categories differ in the <strong class="emphasis bold">type of property</strong> that can be stolen and the <strong class="emphasis bold">method</strong> of stealing. Modern jurisdictions combine all three categories of nonviolent theft into one <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">consolidated theft statute</a><span class="glossdef">A statute that criminalizes theft by larceny, embezzlement, and false pretenses.</span></span>, with a uniform grading system largely dependent on the <em class="emphasis">value</em> of the stolen property. The Model Penal Code consolidates <em class="emphasis">all</em> nonviolent theft offenses, including receiving stolen property and extortion, under one grading system (Model Penal Code § 223.1). What follows is a discussion of theft as defined in modern consolidated theft statutes, making note of the traditional distinctions among the various theft categories when appropriate. Theft has the elements of criminal act, criminal intent, attendant circumstances, causation, and harm, as is discussed in this chapter.</p>
        <div class="section" id="storm_1.0-ch11_s01_s01_s01">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Consolidated Theft Act</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="storm_1.0-ch11_s01_s01_s01_p01">The <strong class="emphasis bold">criminal act</strong> element required under consolidated theft statutes is stealing <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">real property</a><span class="glossdef">Land and anything permanently attached to it.</span></span>, <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">personal property</a><span class="glossdef">Movable objects.</span></span>, or <strong class="emphasis bold">services</strong>. <strong class="emphasis bold">Real property</strong> is land and anything permanently attached to land, like a building. <strong class="emphasis bold">Personal property</strong> is any movable item. Personal property can be <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">tangible property</a><span class="glossdef">Property that can be touched or held.</span></span>, like money, jewelry, vehicles, electronics, cellular telephones, and clothing. Personal property can also be <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">intangible property</a><span class="glossdef">Property that has value but cannot be touched or held, for example, stocks and bonds.</span></span>, which means it has value, but it cannot be touched or held, like stocks and bonds. The Model Penal Code criminalizes theft by unlawful taking of movable property, theft by deception, theft of services, and theft by failure to make required disposition of funds received under one consolidated grading provision (Model Penal Code §§ 223.1, 223.2, 223.3, 223.7, 223.8).</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="storm_1.0-ch11_s01_s01_s01_p02">The act of stealing can be carried out in more than one way. When the defendant steals by a physical <strong class="emphasis bold">taking</strong>, the theft is generally a <strong class="emphasis bold">larceny</strong> theft. The act of taking is twofold. First, the defendant must <strong class="emphasis bold">gain control</strong> over the item. Then the defendant must <strong class="emphasis bold">move</strong> the item, which is called <strong class="emphasis bold">asportation</strong>, as it is with kidnapping.<span class="footnote" id="storm_1.0-fn11_001"><em class="emphasis">Britt v.

Commonwealth</em>, 667 S.E.2d 763 (2008), accessed March 8, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=2834311189194937383&amp;q=larceny+asportation&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2,5&amp;as_ylo=1999">http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=2834311189194937383&amp;q= larceny+asportation&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2,5&amp;as_ylo=1999</a>.</span> Control plus asportation can be accomplished by the defendant’s physical act or by deceiving the victim into transferring the property with a false representation of fact. This is called <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">larceny by trick</a><span class="glossdef">Theft committed by a false representation of fact that results in the defendant’s possession of the stolen personal property.</span></span>. Because larceny requires a physical taking, it generally only pertains to personal property.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="storm_1.0-ch11_s01_s01_s01_p03">Another way for a defendant to steal property is to <strong class="emphasis bold">convert</strong> it to the defendant’s use or ownership. Conversion generally occurs when the victim transfers <em class="emphasis">possession</em> of the property to the defendant, and the defendant thereafter appropriates the property transferred. When the defendant steals by conversion, the theft is generally an <strong class="emphasis bold">embezzlement</strong> theft.<span class="footnote" id="storm_1.0-fn11_003"><em class="emphasis">Commonwealth v. Mills</em>, 436 Mass. 387 (2002), accessed March 7, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=14428947695245966729&amp;q=larceny+false+pretenses+embezzlement&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2,5&amp;as_ylo=1997">http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=14428947695245966729&amp;q= larceny+false+pretenses+embezzlement&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2,5&amp;as_ylo=1997</a>.</span> Embezzlement could occur when the defendant gains possession of property from a friendship or a family relationship or from a paid relationship such as employer-employee or attorney-client. Embezzlement does not require a physical taking, so it can pertain to real or personal property.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="storm_1.0-ch11_s01_s01_s01_p04">When the defendant steals by a false representation of fact, and the subject of the theft is a <strong class="emphasis bold">service</strong>, the theft is generally a <strong class="emphasis bold">false pretenses</strong> theft.<span class="footnote" id="storm_1.0-fn11_004">Cal.

What differentiates false pretenses from larceny by trick is the <strong class="emphasis bold">status</strong> of the property <em class="emphasis">after</em> it is stolen, which is discussed under the harm element of consolidated theft statutes.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="storm_1.0-ch11_s01_s01_s01_p05">To summarize, whether the defendant steals by a physical taking, a conversion, or a false representation of fact, and whether the defendant steals real or personal property or a service, the crime is theft under modern consolidated theft statutes and is graded primarily on the value of the property or service stolen.</p>

                <h2 class="title editable block">Example of Consolidated Theft Act</h2>
                <p class="para editable block" id="storm_1.0-ch11_s01_s01_s01_s01_p01">Jeremy stops by the local convenience store on his way to work and buys some cigarettes. Before paying for the cigarettes, Jeremy slips a package of chewing gum into his pocket and does not pay for it. Jeremy continues walking to his job at a local gas station. When one of the customers buys gas, Jeremy only rings him up for half of the amount purchased. Once the gas station closes, Jeremy takes the other half out of the cash register and puts it in his pocket with the chewing gum. After work, Jeremy decides to have a drink at a nearby bar. While enjoying his drink, he meets a patron named Chuck, who is a taxi driver. Chuck mentions that his taxi needs a tune-up. Jeremy offers to take Chuck back to the gas station and do the tune-up in exchange for a taxi ride home. Chuck eagerly agrees. The two drive to the gas station, and Jeremy suggests that Chuck take a walk around the block while he performs the tune-up. While Chuck is gone, Jeremy lifts the hood of the taxi and then proceeds to read a magazine. When Chuck returns twenty-five minutes later, Jeremy tells him the tune-up is complete. Chuck thereafter drives Jeremy home for free.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="storm_1.0-ch11_s01_s01_s01_s01_p02">In this scenario, Jeremy has performed three separate acts of theft. When Jeremy slips the package of chewing gum into his pocket without paying for it, he has physically <strong class="emphasis bold">taken</strong> personal property, which is a <strong class="emphasis bold">larceny</strong> theft. When Jeremy fails to ring up the entire sale for a customer and pockets the rest from the cash register, he has <strong class="emphasis bold">converted</strong> the owner of the gas station’s cash for his own use, which is an <strong class="emphasis bold">embezzlement</strong> theft. When Jeremy <strong class="emphasis bold">falsely represents</strong> to Chuck that he has performed a tune-up of Chuck’s taxi and receives a free taxi ride in payment, he has falsely represented a fact in exchange for a service, which is a <strong class="emphasis bold">false pretenses</strong> theft. All three of these acts of theft could be prosecuted under <em class="emphasis">one</em> consolidated theft statute. The three stolen items have a relatively low value, so these crimes would probably be graded as a misdemeanor. Grading of theft under consolidated theft statutes is discussed shortly.</p>

The Model Penal Code requires <strong class="emphasis bold">purposeful</strong> intent for theft by unlawful taking, deception, theft of services, and theft by failure to make required disposition of funds received (Model Penal Code §§ 223.2, 223.3, 223.7, 223.8).</p>

                <p class="para editable block" id="storm_1.0-ch11_s01_s01_s02_s01_p01">Jorge goes to the nursery and spends hundreds of dollars on plants for his garden. Some of the plants are delicate and must be put into the ground immediately after purchase. When Jorge gets home, he discovers that he has no shovel because he loaned it to his brother-in-law a few weeks ago. He notices that his neighbor’s shovel is leaning against his neighbor’s garage. If Jorge borrows his neighbor’s shovel so that he can get his expensive plants into the ground, this appropriation would probably <em class="emphasis">not</em> constitute the crime of theft under a consolidated theft statute in certain jurisdictions. Jorge had the intent to perform the theft act of <strong class="emphasis bold">taking</strong> personal property. However, Jorge did not have the specific or purposeful intent to deprive his neighbor of the shovel <em class="emphasis">permanently</em>, which is often required for larceny theft. Thus in this scenario, Jorge may not be charged with and convicted of a consolidated theft offense.</p>

Jorge retrieves the shovel, uses it to put his plants into the ground, and then puts it into his toolshed and locks the door.

            <ul class="itemizedlist" id="storm_1.0-ch11_s01_s02_l01">
                <li>The criminal act element required for consolidated theft statutes is stealing real or personal property or services. The defendant can commit the theft by a physical taking (larceny), conversion of property in the defendant’s possession (embezzlement), or a false representation of fact (false pretenses or larceny by trick).</li>
                <li>The criminal intent element required for consolidated theft statutes is either specific intent or purposely, or general intent or knowingly to perform the criminal act, depending on the jurisdiction. When the criminal intent is specific or purposely, the defendant must intend the criminal act of stealing and must also intend to keep the stolen property. For false pretenses or larceny by trick theft, in many jurisdictions the defendant must have general intent or knowledge that the representation of fact is false and must make the false representation with the specific intent or purposely to deceive.</li>
                <li>
                    <p class="para">All theft generally requires the attendant circumstances that the property stolen is the property of another, and victim consent to the taking, conversion, or transfer of ownership is lacking.</p>
                    <ul class="itemizedlist" id="storm_1.0-ch11_s01_s02_l02">
                        <li>In many jurisdictions, embezzlement theft under a consolidated theft statute requires the attendant circumstance element of a relationship of trust and confidence between the victim and the defendant.</li>
                        <li>A false pretenses or larceny by trick theft under a consolidated theft statute requires the additional attendant circumstance element of victim reliance on the false representation of fact made by the defendant.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>The harm element required for consolidated theft statutes is the victim’s temporary or permanent loss of property or services, no matter how slight the value. When the defendant gains possession of personal property by a false representation of fact, the theft is larceny by trick theft. When the defendant gains ownership of personal property or possession of money, the theft is false pretenses theft.</li>
                <li>Theft can be graded by degrees or as petty theft, which is theft of property with low value, and grand theft, which is theft of property with significant value. Petty theft or theft of the second or third degree is generally a misdemeanor, while grand theft or theft of the first degree is generally a felony, felony-misdemeanor, or gross misdemeanor, depending on the amount stolen or whether the item stolen is a firearm.</li>
                <li>The criminal act element required for federal mail fraud is the use of the federal postal service to further any scheme to defraud. The criminal intent element required for this offense is general intent, knowingly, or awareness that the postal service will be used. The criminal act supported by the criminal intent must be the factual and legal cause of the harm, which is the placement of anything in a depository or postal office that furthers the scheme to defraud. Federal mail fraud is a felony.</li>

            <ol class="orderedlist" id="storm_1.0-ch11_s01_s02_l03">
                <li>Recall a scenario in <a class="xref" href="storm_1.0-ch01#storm_1.0-ch01">Chapter 1 "Introduction to Criminal Law"</a> where Linda and Clara browse an expensive department store’s lingerie department and Linda surreptitiously places a bra in her purse and leaves the store without paying for it. What type of theft did Linda commit in this scenario?</li>
                <li>Ellen goes to the fine jewelry department at Macy’s and asks the clerk if she can see a Rolex watch, valued at ten thousand dollars. The clerk takes the watch out of the case and lays it on the counter. Ellen tells the clerk that her manager is signaling. When the clerk turns around, Ellen puts her hand over the watch and begins to slide it across the counter and <em class="emphasis">into her open purse</em>. Before the watch slides off the counter, the clerk turns back around and pins Ellen’s hand to the counter, shouting for a security guard. Has Ellen committed a crime in this scenario? If your answer is yes, which crime?</li>
                <li>Read <em class="emphasis">State v. Larson</em>, 605 N.W. 2d 706 (2000). In <em class="emphasis">Larson</em>, the defendant, the owner of an automobile leasing company, was convicted of theft by temporary taking under a consolidated theft statute for failing to return security deposits to customers pursuant to their automobile lease contracts. The defendant appealed, claiming that the lease deposits were not the “property of another.” Did the Supreme Court of Minnesota uphold the defendant’s conviction? Why or why not?

                <li>Read <em class="emphasis">People v. Traster</em>, 111 Cal. App. 4th 1377 (2003). In <em class="emphasis">Traster</em>, the defendant told his employer that it was necessary to purchase computer-licensing agreements, and he was given the employer credit card to purchase them. The defendant thereafter appropriated the money, never purchased the licenses, and quit his job a few days later.

                <li>Read <em class="emphasis">U.S. v. Ingles</em>, 445 F.3d 830 (2006). In <em class="emphasis">Ingles</em>, the defendant was convicted of federal mail fraud when his son’s cabin was burned by arson and his son made a claim for homeowner’s insurance. The evidence indicated that the defendant was involved in the arson. The defendant’s son was <strong class="emphasis bold">acquitted</strong> of the arson, and only the insurance company, which sent several letters to the defendant’s son, did the acts of mailing.

Change this example so that Chip is not a dealer and is offered the iPod for one hundred dollars, which is fairly close to its actual value. Chip purchases the iPod from Heather and thereafter drives home. When he gets home, he begins to open the box and notices the message stating that the iPod is the property of Eugene Schumaker. Chip thinks about it for a minute, continues to open the box, and then retains the iPod for the next six months. If Chip is in a state that defines the criminal act element for receiving stolen property as <strong class="emphasis bold">retains</strong>, then Chip most likely committed the criminal act with the appropriate criminal intent (knowledge that the property is stolen) and may be subject to prosecution for and conviction of this offense.</p>

                    <li>The criminal act element required for extortion is typically a theft of property accomplished by a threat to cause future harm to the victim.</li>
                    <li>The criminal intent element required for extortion is typically the specific intent or purposely to unlawfully deprive the victim of property permanently. However, in some jurisdictions, it is the general intent or knowingly to perform the criminal act.</li>
                    <li>In many jurisdictions, it is an affirmative defense to extortion that the property taken by threat to expose a secret or accuse anyone of a criminal offense is taken honestly, as compensation for property, or as restitution or indemnification for harm done by the secret or crime.</li>
                    <li>The attendant circumstances of extortion are that the property belongs to another and that the victim consents to transferring the property to the defendant based on fear inspired by the defendant’s threat.</li>
                    <li>The harm element required for extortion is that the defendant obtains the property of another.</li>
                    <li>Extortion is graded as a felony in most jurisdictions.</li>
                    <li>Robbery requires a taking accomplished by force or threat of imminent force. Extortion requires a taking by threat of future harm that is not necessarily force, and larceny generally requires a taking by stealth or a false representation of fact. Robbery also requires the attendant circumstance that the property be taken from the victim’s person or presence and is generally graded more severely than larceny or extortion.</li>
                    <li>Robbery is typically graded as a serious felony, which is a strike in jurisdictions that have three strikes statutes, and a predicate felony for first-degree felony murder.</li>
                    <li>The criminal act element required for receiving stolen property is typically buying-receiving, retaining, and selling-disposing of stolen personal property.</li>
                    <li>The defendant must have the intent to commit the criminal act of receiving stolen property, which could be specific intent or purposely, general intent or knowingly, recklessly, or negligently to either buy-receive or sell-dispose of stolen personal property, depending on the jurisdiction. If “retain” is the criminal act element specified in the receiving stolen property statute, a defendant who obtains property without knowledge that it is stolen commits the offense if he or she thereafter keeps property after discovering that it is stolen. The defendant must also have the specific intent or purposeful desire to deprive the victim of the property permanently in some jurisdictions.</li>
                    <li>A failure of proof or affirmative defense to receiving stolen property in some jurisdictions is that the defendant received and retained the stolen property with the intent to return it to the true owner.</li>
                    <li>The attendant circumstances for receiving stolen property are that the property belongs to another and lack of victim consent. The harm element of receiving stolen property is that the defendant buy-receive, retain, or sell-dispose of stolen personal property.</li>
                    <li>Receiving stolen property is graded as a felony-misdemeanor or a misdemeanor if the stolen property is of low value and a felony if the stolen property is of high value.</li>

                <li>The criminal act element required for burglary is breaking and entering, just entering, or remaining.</li>
                <li>The criminal intent element required for burglary is typically the general intent or knowingly to commit the criminal act and the specific intent or purposely to commit a felony, any crime, or a felony, petty, or grand theft once inside the burglarized area.</li>
                <li>Burglary generally includes the attendant circumstances that the area entered is a structure, building, or vehicle belonging to another, or an occupied building or structure, or a dwelling. Modern jurisdictions have eliminated the requirement that the property belong to another and prohibit the defendant from burglarizing his or her own property. Some jurisdictions require a vehicle to be locked, and a few jurisdictions require the burglary to take place at nighttime.</li>
                <li>Burglary is typically graded as a felony that is divided into degrees. First-degree burglary is often a strike in jurisdictions that have three strikes statutes and a predicate felony for first-degree felony murder.</li>
                <li>Typically, criminal trespass is an unauthorized (attendant circumstance) entry or remaining (criminal act) into a building, occupied structure, or place as to which notice against trespassing is given, owned by another (attendant circumstance) with general intent or knowingly that the entry was unauthorized (criminal intent). Criminal trespass is generally graded as a felony, albeit a less serious felony than burglary, or a misdemeanor if the area trespassed is a place rather than an occupied building or structure.</li>
                <li>The criminal act element required for arson is starting a fire, burning, or damaging with fire or explosives specified real or personal property.</li>
                <li>The criminal intent element required for arson is the general intent or knowingly to commit the criminal act in many jurisdictions.</li>
                <li>Arson statutes can specify the attendant circumstance that the defendant burns a specific type of property, such as a dwelling or other real or personal property. In most jurisdictions, if the defendant burns his or her own property, the defendant must act with the specific intent or purposely to defraud, typically an insurance carrier.</li>
                <li>The harm element required for arson is burning, charring, damage, or, in the most extreme cases, smoke damage.</li>
                <li>Arson is typically graded as a felony that is divided into degrees. First-degree arson is often a strike in jurisdictions that have three strikes statutes and a predicate felony for first-degree felony murder. Arson could also carry a registration requirement like serious sex offenses.</li>
                <li>The elements of criminal mischief are damaging or destroying property, tampering with property, or deception or threat that leads to a loss of property (criminal act and harm) with specific intent or purposely, general intent or knowingly, recklessly, or negligently. Although criminal mischief may be a felony in many jurisdictions, it is generally a less serious felony than arson and in some jurisdictions it is graded as a gross misdemeanor or misdemeanor.</li>

        <h3 class="title">Summary</h3>
        <p class="para" id="storm_1.0-ch11_s04_p01">Crimes against property include theft, crimes connected to theft, and crimes that invade or damage property. Modern jurisdictions criminalize several forms of theft under consolidated theft statutes that grade theft primarily on the value of the property stolen. Larceny under a consolidated theft statute in many jurisdictions is the physical taking or gaining possession of a victim’s personal property by control and asportation, or a false representation of fact, with the intent to keep the property. Embezzlement under a consolidated theft statute is the conversion of a victim’s real or personal property entrusted to the defendant. False pretenses under a consolidated theft statute is the permanent transfer of ownership of real or personal property or services from the victim to the defendant, based on a false representation of fact. The theft of property of low value is typically a misdemeanor (petty theft), while the theft of property of high value (grand theft) is a felony, felony-misdemeanor, or a gross misdemeanor, depending on the circumstances and the jurisdiction. Federal mail fraud, a felony, is the knowing use of the mail to perpetrate a scheme to defraud.</p>
        <p class="para" id="storm_1.0-ch11_s04_p02">Extortion is the purposeful theft of property by a threat of future harm such as bodily injury or exposure of the victim’s crime or secret that subjects the victim to hatred, contempt, or ridicule. Extortion is typically graded as a felony. Robbery is the purposeful theft of property from the victim’s person or presence by force or threat of imminent physical harm. Robbery is typically graded as a serious felony. Receiving stolen property is receiving, buying, selling, disposing of, or retaining stolen property with either knowledge or awareness that the property is stolen or knowledge or awareness of a risk that the property is stolen. Receiving stolen property is typically graded as a felony-misdemeanor or a misdemeanor if the property is of low value and a felony if the property is of significant value.</p>
        <p class="para" id="storm_1.0-ch11_s04_p03">Burglary is either breaking and entering, entering, or remaining on another’s property with the intent to commit a felony, any crime, grand theft, or petty theft once inside. In some jurisdictions, the defendant can burglarize his or her own property. Burglary is typically graded as a serious felony. Criminal trespass is a knowing unauthorized entry onto the property of another. Criminal trespass is typically graded as a less serious felony than burglary, or a misdemeanor if the trespass is into a place, rather than an occupied building or structure. Arson is knowingly burning or damaging by fire property described in the arson statute. Arson is typically graded as a serious felony. Criminal mischief is damaging, destroying, or interfering with property with specific intent or purposely, general intent or knowingly, recklessly, or negligently, depending on the jurisdiction and the degree of the offense. Criminal mischief is typically graded as a less serious felony than arson, a gross misdemeanor, or a misdemeanor.</p>

        <ol class="orderedlist" id="storm_1.0-ch11_s04_l06">
            <li>Linda has committed <strong class="emphasis bold">larceny</strong> because she <strong class="emphasis bold">took</strong> personal property belonging to another without consent and with what appears to be the intent to keep it permanently. Shoplifting is typically larceny. A bra is not a high-value item (even in an expensive department store), so Linda’s larceny is probably petty, second-, or third-degree theft under a consolidated theft statute.</li>
            <li>Ellen has committed <strong class="emphasis bold">larceny</strong> because she <strong class="emphasis bold">took</strong> personal property belonging to another without consent and with what appears to be the intent to keep it permanently. When Ellen put her hand over the Rolex watch, she gained <strong class="emphasis bold">control</strong> of it. When she slid it across the counter, this was sufficient <strong class="emphasis bold">asportation</strong> of the property because asportation for larceny can generally be any distance—no matter how slight. The Rolex is valued at ten thousand dollars, so Ellen’s larceny is probably grand or first-degree theft under a consolidated theft statute.</li>
            <li>The Minnesota Supreme Court reversed, holding that the lease deposits were held in trust and belonged to the <em class="emphasis">defendant</em>, not the lessees. The court also held that the prosecution failed to prove a relationship of <strong class="emphasis bold">trust</strong> and <strong class="emphasis bold">confidence</strong> between the defendant and the lessees, which is required in Minnesota for embezzlement theft under the consolidated theft statute.</li>
            <li>The Court of Appeal of California modified the defendant’s conviction under a consolidated theft statute. The court held that the defendant actually committed attempted <strong class="emphasis bold">larceny by trick</strong>, not false pretenses, because he was directed to purchase licensing agreements with the money, which put him in <em class="emphasis">possession</em> of it rather than <em class="emphasis">ownership</em>.</li>
            <li>The US Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit reversed the defendant’s conviction. The court held that the <em class="emphasis">defendant</em> did not have to use the mails or intend that the mails be used by another to be convicted of federal mail fraud. However, because all the mailings involved the defendant’s <em class="emphasis">son</em>, who was acquitted of the arson and therefore not involved in a scheme to defraud the insurance company, the defendant’s mail fraud conviction had no basis.</li>

        <p class="simpara">From <a class="xref" href="storm_1.0-ch11_s02#storm_1.0-ch11_s02">Section 11.2 "Extortion, Robbery, and Receiving Stolen Property"</a></p>
        <ol class="orderedlist" id="storm_1.0-ch11_s04_l07">
            <li>Chuck has committed the crime of <strong class="emphasis bold">attempted extortion</strong>. Although Chuck threatened to expose Jeremy’s crime of false pretenses with the intent to force Jeremy to pay him two hundred dollars, Jeremy did <em class="emphasis">not pay</em> Chuck. Thus the <strong class="emphasis bold">harm</strong> element of extortion is lacking, and Chuck’s conduct is only attempted extortion.</li>
            <li>The Court of Appeals of North Carolina reversed the defendant’s robbery conviction because he <em class="emphasis">snatched</em> the purse, using only the force required to take it from the victim’s possession. Thus the crime was most likely <strong class="emphasis bold">larceny</strong> rather than <strong class="emphasis bold">robbery</strong>.</li>
            <li>The Court of Appeals of Michigan upheld the defendant’s conviction. Although the court conceded that a theft by larceny requires the intent to <em class="emphasis">permanently</em> deprive the owner of personal property, the court held that the term “stolen” in the receiving stolen property statute encompasses more than larceny theft, and thus it includes <em class="emphasis">any taking</em> of personal property without permission of the owner.</li>

        <ol class="orderedlist" id="storm_1.0-ch11_s04_l08">
            <li>Burglary of a <strong class="emphasis bold">dwelling</strong> is graded higher than burglary of a structure or vehicle because it is likely that the owners of a dwelling might be inside and might employ protective actions that could lead to <em class="emphasis">injury</em> or <em class="emphasis">death</em>. Burglary at <strong class="emphasis bold">nighttime</strong> enhances the probability that the dwelling owners will be home and makes it more difficult to identify the defendant. This could also enhance the probability of injury or death and reduce the chances of conviction, which does not serve <strong class="emphasis bold">deterrence</strong>.</li>
            <li>The Court of Appeal of Florida held that the evidence was <em class="emphasis">insufficient</em> to warrant the <strong class="emphasis bold">necessity</strong> jury instruction. Although a neighbor to the burglarized residence testified that the defendant rang her doorbell and asked to come in while looking around in a scared manner, and a guest at a party testified that the defendant was slapped by an individual claiming the defendant owed him money, the court held that this evidence did not establish the defendant’s reasonable belief that he was at risk for immediate serious bodily injury.</li>
            <li>The Court of Appeals of Texas dismissed the minor’s judgment of adjudication because the middle school was not located in “the incorporated city limits,” as was alleged in the State’s petition for adjudication.</li>

        <h3 class="title">Answers to Law and Ethics Questions</h3>
        <ol class="orderedlist" id="storm_1.0-ch11_s04_l09">
            <li>Whether it is ethical to publish classified information depends on the <strong class="emphasis bold">content</strong> of the published material, and requires a balancing of the public’s right to know and the safety risk posed by the publication. If the publication exposes government corruption or another topic that could lead to government reform <em class="emphasis">and</em> the risk of harm is minimal, then many would feel the exposure is of high value and ethical.</li>
            <li>The First Amendment complicates the prosecution of WikiLeaks for simply publishing information provided by an informant. Without evidence that WikiLeaks <em class="emphasis">participated</em> or <em class="emphasis">assisted</em> the government informant, a prosecution of WikiLeaks is a prosecution for <strong class="emphasis bold">speech</strong>, and this requires a compelling government interest and a narrowly tailored statute. Of course the government has a strong interest in protecting those involved in national defense; however, government speech has traditionally been accorded the <em class="emphasis">highest</em> form of protection from censorship. An additional problem is the Constitution’s prohibition against the enactment of <strong class="emphasis bold">ex post facto</strong> laws because it does not appear that there is a statute addressing WikiLeaks’ behavior (government property cannot be copyrighted, trademarked, or patented, so there was no intellectual property infringement).</li>
