        <p class="para editable block" id="storm_1.0-ch10_s03_s01_p01">Domestic violence statutes generally focus on criminal conduct that occurs between <strong class="emphasis bold">family</strong> members. Although family cruelty or interfamily criminal behavior is not a new phenomenon, enforcement of criminal statutes against family members can be challenging because of dependence, fear, and other issues that are particular to the family unit. In addition, historical evidence indicates that law enforcement can be reluctant to get involved in <em class="emphasis">family disputes</em> and often fails to adequately <em class="emphasis">protect</em> victims who are trapped in the same residence as the defendant. Specific enforcement measures that are crafted to apply to defendants and victims who are family members are an innovative statutory approach that many jurisdictions are beginning to adopt. In general, domestic violence statutes target crimes against the person, for example, assault, battery, sex offenses, kidnapping, and criminal homicide.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Stalking</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="storm_1.0-ch10_s03_s02_p01">California was the first state to enact a stalking law in 1990, in response to the high-profile murder of a young actress named Rebecca Schaeffer whose attacker stalked her for two years. Now <em class="emphasis">all states</em> and the federal government have stalking laws.<span class="footnote" id="storm_1.0-fn10_102">18 U.S.C. § 2261A, accessed February 22, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.ncvc.org/src/main.aspx?dbID=DB_Federal_Interstate_Stalking_Institute163#61a">http://www.ncvc.org/src/main.aspx?dbID=DB_Federal_Interstate_Stalking_Institute163#61a</a>.</span> Although statutes criminalizing stalking are gender-neutral, in reality, most stalking victims are women, and most stalking defendants are men.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="storm_1.0-ch10_s03_s02_p02">Before the states enacted stalking laws, a victim who was threatened and harassed but not assaulted had no remedy except to go to court and obtain a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">restraining order</a><span class="glossdef">A court order forbidding the defendant from contacting or coming within a certain distance of the victim.</span></span>. A restraining order is a court order mandating that the defendant neither contact nor come within a certain distance of the victim. If the defendant violated the restraining order, law enforcement could arrest him or her. Until a restraining order was in place, however, the defendant was free to continue frightening the victim. Restraining orders typically take some time to obtain. The victim must contact and employ an attorney and also set up a court hearing. For this reason, the restraining order method of preventing a defendant from stalking was cumbersome, ineffective, and frequently resulted in force or violence against the stalking victim.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="storm_1.0-ch10_s03_s02_p03">The modern crime of stalking allows law enforcement to arrest and incapacitate defendants <em class="emphasis">before</em> they complete an assault, battery, or other violent crime against a victim. Like all crimes, stalking requires the defendant to commit a voluntary act supported by criminal intent. In many jurisdictions, stalking also has the elements of causation and harm, as is discussed in <a class="xref" href="#storm_1.0-ch10_s03_s02">Section 10.3.2 "Stalking"</a>.</p>

Lisa frowns and walks away. Elliot then follows Lisa and tells her that he will “make her pay” for not loving him. Lisa ignores Elliot’s statement, climbs into her car, and drives away. Later that evening, Elliot rings Lisa’s doorbell. Lisa does not answer the door but yells at Elliot, telling him to leave. Disgruntled and angry, Elliot carves, “you will die for not loving me” into Lisa’s front door with his pocketknife.</p>

In jurisdictions that require subjective <strong class="emphasis bold">and</strong> objective victim fear as the harm element for stalking, Elliot must cause <em class="emphasis">Lisa</em> to experience fear that is <em class="emphasis">reasonable</em> under the circumstances. In a jurisdiction that requires only subjective victim fear, Elliot must cause Lisa to feel fear, either reasonably or unreasonably. In a jurisdiction that requires only objective fear, Elliot must act in a manner that would cause a reasonable victim under similar circumstances to experience fear. Keep in mind that if Lisa is aware of a circumstance that makes it unlikely that Elliot can carry out his threat, Elliot <em class="emphasis">could not</em> be convicted of stalking in a jurisdiction that requires Lisa to experience <em class="emphasis">subjective</em> fear.</p>

                    <li>Individuals covered by domestic violence statutes are relatives by blood or marriage, individuals who share a child, ex-spouses and ex-lovers, and individuals who reside together.</li>
                    <li>Some special features of domestic violence statutes are special training for law enforcement in domestic issues, protection of the victim by no-contact orders and nondisclosure of the victim’s residence address, the duty of law enforcement or prosecutors to inform the victim of the decision of whether to prosecute and the duty to inform the victim of special procedures available to protect domestic violence victims, the ability to arrest domestic violence offenders with or without a warrant, special factors to consider in the sentencing of domestic violence defendants, and peace officer immunity for enforcement of domestic violence provisions.</li>
                    <li>The criminal act element required for stalking varies, but in general it is repeatedly engaging in a course of conduct that poses a credible threat to the victim’s safety, including following, harassing, approaching, or pursuing the victim.</li>
                    <li>The criminal intent supporting the stalking criminal act is specific intent or purposely in most jurisdictions. Some jurisdictions require a different criminal intent to support the harm requirement: either specific intent or purposely, general intent or knowingly, reckless intent, negligent intent, or strict liability.</li>
                    <li>Some jurisdictions require the defendant to cause harm, which is victim fear of serious bodily injury, fear of death of the victim or the victim’s family member, or damage to the victim’s property. The test for victim fear varies and could be either subjective and objective fear, just subjective fear, or just objective fear.</li>
                    <li>It is common to divide stalking into degrees or grade it as simple and aggravated. First-degree or aggravated stalking is generally graded as a felony, and second-degree or simple stalking is generally graded as a misdemeanor. Factors that can aggravate grading are the violation of a restraining or protective order, the use of a weapon, a youthful victim, or previous convictions for stalking.</li>

                    <li>Read <em class="emphasis">State v. Holbach</em>, 2009 ND 37 (2009). In <em class="emphasis">Holbach</em>, the defendant appealed a conviction for stalking based on his constitutionally protected right to travel around town and do errands. The defendant was on probation for stalking the victim and subject to conditions of probation, including a stay-away order. However, the victim claimed that she saw the defendant following her around town on many occasions. Did the Supreme Court of North Dakota uphold the defendant’s stalking conviction? Why or why not?

                    <li>Read <em class="emphasis">Burke v. State</em>, 676 S.E.2d 766 (2009).
