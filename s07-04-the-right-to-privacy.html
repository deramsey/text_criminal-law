        <h2 class="title editable block">The Constitutional Amendments Protecting Privacy</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="storm_1.0-ch03_s04_s01_p01">US Supreme Court precedent has held that the right to privacy comes from the First, Third, Fourth, Fifth, Ninth, and Fourteenth Amendments. The First Amendment protects the right to speak freely, assemble peacefully, and worship according to individual choice. The Third Amendment prohibits the government from forcing individuals to quarter, house, or feed soldiers. The Fourth Amendment prevents the government from unreasonably searching or seizing an individual or an individual’s property. The Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments provide due process of law before the government can deprive an individual of life, liberty, or property. The Ninth Amendment states that rights not explicitly set forth in the Constitution may still exist. Taken together, these amendments indicate that the Constitution was written to erect a barrier between individuals and an <em class="emphasis">overly intrusive</em> and <em class="emphasis">regulatory</em> government. In modern society, this right to privacy guarantees the right to use <em class="emphasis">birth control</em>, the right to an <em class="emphasis">abortion</em>, and the right to <em class="emphasis">participate in consensual sexual relations</em>.</p>

The Court held that state government has a <em class="emphasis">legitimate</em> interest in protecting a pregnant woman and her fetus from harm, which becomes a <em class="emphasis">compelling</em> interest when she has reached full term.
