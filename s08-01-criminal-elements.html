        <p class="para editable block" id="storm_1.0-ch04_s01_s01_p01">Janine gets into a fight with her boyfriend Conrad after the senior prom. She grabs Conrad’s car keys out of his hand, jumps into his car, and locks all the doors. When Conrad strides over to the car, she starts the engine, puts the car into drive, and tries to run him down. It is dark and difficult for Janine to see, so Conrad easily gets out of her way and is unharmed. However, Janine is thereafter arrested and charged with attempted murder. In this case, the prosecution has to prove the elements of <strong class="emphasis bold">criminal act</strong>, <strong class="emphasis bold">criminal intent</strong>, and <strong class="emphasis bold">concurrence</strong> for attempted murder. The prosecution does <em class="emphasis">not</em> have to prove <strong class="emphasis bold">causation</strong> or that Conrad was <strong class="emphasis bold">harmed</strong> because attempt crimes, including attempted murder, do not have a bad result requirement. Attempt and other incomplete or inchoate crimes are discussed in <a class="xref" href="storm_1.0-ch08#storm_1.0-ch08">Chapter 8 "Inchoate Offenses"</a>.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="storm_1.0-ch04_s01_s02_s01_p01">One requirement of criminal act is that the defendant perform it <em class="emphasis">voluntarily</em>. In other words, the defendant must <em class="emphasis">control</em> the act. It would not serve the policy of specific deterrence to punish the defendant for irrepressible acts. The Model Penal Code gives the following examples of acts that are not voluntary and, therefore, not criminal: reflexes, convulsions, bodily movements during unconsciousness or sleep, conduct during hypnosis or resulting from hypnotic suggestion, or a bodily movement that otherwise is not a product of the effort or determination of the actor, either conscious or habitual (Model Penal Code § 2.01 (2)). <em class="emphasis">One voluntary act</em> is enough to fulfill the voluntary act requirement. Thus if a <em class="emphasis">voluntary</em> act is followed by an <em class="emphasis">involuntary</em> one, the court may still impose criminal liability depending on the circumstances.<span class="footnote" id="storm_1.0-fn04_002"><em class="emphasis">Govt. of Virgin Islands v.

The hypnotist directs Perry to smash a banana cream pie into his girlfriend Shelley’s face. Smashing a pie into a person’s face is probably <em class="emphasis">battery</em> in most states, but Perry did not commit the act <em class="emphasis">voluntarily</em>, so he should not be convicted of a crime. Punishing Perry for battery would not specifically deter Perry from performing the act again while hypnotized because he is not in control of his behavior when experiencing this mental state.</p>

Timothy can probably be convicted of one or more crimes in this situation. Timothy’s acts of drinking several glasses of wine and then driving a vehicle are <em class="emphasis">voluntary</em>. Thus even though Timothy got into a car accident while unconscious, his involuntary act was preceded by conscious, controllable, and voluntary action. A punishment in this instance could <em class="emphasis">specifically deter</em> Timothy from drinking and driving on another occasion and is appropriate based on the circumstances.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Status as a Criminal Act</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="storm_1.0-ch04_s01_s03_p01">Generally, a defendant’s <strong class="emphasis bold">status</strong> in society is not a criminal act. Status is <em class="emphasis">who</em> the defendant is, not what the defendant <em class="emphasis">does</em>. Similar to punishment for an involuntary act, when the government punishes an individual for status, it is essentially targeting that individual for circumstances that are outside his or her control. This punishment may be cruel and unusual pursuant to the Eighth Amendment if it is disproportionate to the defendant’s behavior.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="storm_1.0-ch04_s01_s03_p02">In <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=3358010003227436496&amp;q=Robinson+v.+California&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2,5"><em class="emphasis">Robinson v. California</em></a>, 370 U.S. 660 (1962), the US Supreme Court held that it is unconstitutional as cruel and unusual punishment pursuant to the Eighth Amendment to punish an individual for the <strong class="emphasis bold">status</strong> of being a drug addict—even if the drugs to which the defendant is addicted are <em class="emphasis">illegal</em>. The Court compared drug addiction to an illness, such as leprosy or venereal disease. Punishing a defendant for being sick not only is inhumane but also does <em class="emphasis">not</em> specifically deter, similar to a punishment for an involuntary act.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="storm_1.0-ch04_s01_s03_p03">If the defendant can control the actions at issue in spite of his or her status, the defendant’s conduct can be constitutionally criminalized and punished pursuant to the Eighth Amendment.

Texas</em></a>, 392 U.S. 514 (1968), the US Supreme Court upheld the defendant’s conviction for “drunk in public,” in spite of the defendant’s status as an alcoholic. The Court held that it is difficult <em class="emphasis">but not impossible</em> for an alcoholic to resist the urge to drink, so the behavior the statute criminalized was voluntary. Also, the Court ruled that the state has an interest in treating alcoholism and preventing alcohol-related crimes that could injure the defendant and others. Pursuant to <em class="emphasis">Powell</em>, statutes that criminalize <em class="emphasis">voluntary acts</em> that <em class="emphasis">arise</em> from status are constitutional under the Eighth Amendment.</p>

            <h2 class="title editable block">Example of a Constitutional Statute Related to Status</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="storm_1.0-ch04_s01_s03_s01_p01">Refer to the example in <a class="xref" href="#storm_1.0-ch04_s01_s02_s01_s02">Section 4 "Example of a Voluntary Act Followed by a Nonvoluntary Act"</a>, where Timothy drives under the influence of alcohol and kills another. A state statute that criminalizes killing another person while driving under the influence is constitutional as applied to Timothy, even if Timothy is an alcoholic. The state has an interest in treating alcoholism and preventing alcohol-related crimes that could injure or kill Timothy or another person. Timothy’s act of driving while intoxicated is <em class="emphasis">voluntary</em>, even if his status as an alcoholic makes it more difficult for Timothy to control his drinking. Thus Timothy and other alcoholic defendants can be prosecuted and punished for killing another person while driving under the influence without violating the Eighth Amendment.</p>

Brianna writes her thoughts in a diary, documenting how she intends to rig the gas line so that gas is pumped into the house all night while Phoebe is sleeping. Brianna includes the date that she wants to kill Phoebe in her most recent diary entry. As Brianna leaves Phoebe’s house, her diary accidentally falls out of her purse. Later, Phoebe finds the diary on the floor and reads it. Phoebe calls the police, gives them Brianna’s diary, and insists they arrest Brianna for attempted murder. Although Brianna’s murder plot is sinister and is documented in her diary, an arrest is improper in this case. Brianna cannot be punished for her <em class="emphasis">thoughts alone</em>. If Brianna took substantial steps toward killing Phoebe, an attempted murder charge might be appropriate. However, at this stage, Brianna is only <em class="emphasis">planning</em> a crime, not <em class="emphasis">committing</em> a crime. Phoebe may be able to go to court and get a restraining order against Brianna to prevent her from carrying out her murder plot, but Brianna cannot be incapacitated by arrest and prosecution for attempted murder in this case.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="storm_1.0-ch04_s01_s05_s02_p01">A duty to act can be based on a contract between the defendant and another party. The most prevalent examples would be a physician’s contractual duty to help a patient or a lifeguard’s duty to save someone who is drowning. Keep in mind that <em class="emphasis">experts</em> who are <em class="emphasis">not</em> contractually bound can ignore an individual’s pleas for help without committing a crime, no matter how morally abhorrent that may seem.

            <p class="para editable block" id="storm_1.0-ch04_s01_s05_s03_p01">A special relationship may also be the basis of a legal duty to act. The most common special relationships are parent-child, spouse-spouse, and employer-employee. Often, the rationale for creating a legal duty to act when people are in a special relationship is the <em class="emphasis">dependence</em> of one individual on another. A parent has the obligation by law to provide food, clothing, shelter, and medical care for his or her children, because children are dependent on their parents and do not have the ability to procure these items themselves. In addition, if someone puts another person <em class="emphasis">in peril</em>, there may be a duty to <em class="emphasis">rescue</em> that person.<span class="footnote" id="storm_1.0-fn04_008"><em class="emphasis">State ex rel.

        <p class="para editable block" id="storm_1.0-ch04_s01_s06_p01">Although it is passive rather than active, possession is still considered a criminal act. The most common objects that are criminal to possess are illegal contraband, drugs, and weapons. There are two types of possession: <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">actual possession</a><span class="glossdef">The defendant has an item on or very near his or her person.</span></span> and <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">constructive possession</a><span class="glossdef">The defendant has an item within his or her area of control.</span></span>. Actual possession indicates that the defendant has the item on or very near his or her person. Constructive possession indicates that the item is not on the defendant’s person, but is within the defendant’s area of control, such as inside a house or automobile with the defendant.<span class="footnote" id="storm_1.0-fn04_010"><em class="emphasis">State v.

        <p class="para editable block" id="storm_1.0-ch04_s01_s06_p02">Because it is passive, possession should be <em class="emphasis">knowing</em>, meaning the defendant is aware that he or she possesses the item.<span class="footnote" id="storm_1.0-fn04_011">Connecticut Jury Instructions No. 2.11-1, accessed February 13, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.jud.ct.gov/ji/criminal/part2/2.11-1.htm">http://www.jud.ct.gov/ji/criminal/part2/2.11-1.htm</a>.</span> As the Model Penal Code states in § 2.01(4), “[p]ossession is an act, within the meaning of this Section, if the possessor knowingly procured or received the thing possessed or was aware of his control thereof for a sufficient period to have been able to terminate his possession.” In the vast majority of states, a statute permitting a conviction for possession <em class="emphasis">without</em> this knowledge or awareness lacks the criminal intent element and would be unenforceable.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="storm_1.0-ch04_s01_s06_s01_p01">A state has a criminal statute that prohibits “being within 100 feet of any quantity of marijuana.” Ricardo sits next to Jean on the subway.

He discovers that Jean has a large baggie of marijuana in his jacket pocket and arrests Jean and Ricardo for marijuana possession. Ricardo was within one hundred feet of marijuana as prohibited by the statute, but Ricardo <em class="emphasis">should not</em> be prosecuted for marijuana possession. No evidence exists to indicate that Ricardo knew Jean, or knew that Jean possessed marijuana. Thus Ricardo does not have the <strong class="emphasis bold">criminal intent</strong> or mens rea for possession, and the state’s possession statute should not be enforced against him.</p>

                    <li>The elements of a crime are criminal act, criminal intent, concurrence, causation, harm, and attendant circumstances. Only crimes that specify a bad result have the elements of causation and harm.</li>
                    <li>Criminal act is usually an unlawful bodily movement that is defined in a statute, or a case in jurisdictions that allow common-law crimes.</li>
                    <li>The criminal act must be voluntary and cannot be based solely on the status of the defendant or the defendant’s thoughts.</li>
                    <li>An exception to the criminal act element is omission to act.</li>
                    <li>Omission to act could be criminal if there is a statute, contract, or special relationship that creates a legal duty to act in the defendant’s situation.</li>
                    <li>Actual possession means that the item is on or very near the defendant’s person. Constructive possession means that the item is within the defendant’s control, such as inside a house or vehicle with the defendant.</li>
                    <li>In most states, the defendant must be aware that he or she possesses the item to be convicted of possession.</li>

                    <li>Read <em class="emphasis">Oler v. State</em>, 998 S.W.2d 363 (1999). In <em class="emphasis">Oler</em>, the defendant was convicted of possession of a controlled substance by misrepresentation.

The defendant appealed, arguing that he had no <em class="emphasis">legal duty</em> to disclose his previous receipt of the drug to the physicians, and was therefore unlawfully punished for an <strong class="emphasis bold">omission to act</strong>.
