        <h3 class="title">Summary</h3>
        <p class="para" id="storm_1.0-ch09_s07_p01">Homicide is the killing of one human being by another. Criminal homicide is either murder or manslaughter. Some states and the federal government also criminalize the killing of a fetus. Suicide is usually not criminal, although assisted suicide could be.</p>
        <p class="para" id="storm_1.0-ch09_s07_p02">Many jurisdictions follow the common law and define murder as the killing of a victim with malice aforethought. Malice can be either a specific intent to kill, which is express malice, or the intent to do serious bodily injury, or depraved heart, which is implied malice. The Model Penal Code defines murder intent as purposely, knowingly, or recklessly under circumstances indicating extreme indifference to life. A killing by the transmission of AIDS can either be murder, if the transmission is deliberate, or manslaughter, if the transmission is inadvertent.</p>
        <p class="para" id="storm_1.0-ch09_s07_p03">Most jurisdictions divide murder into degrees of seriousness. First-degree murder is the most serious, can merit the death penalty in certain jurisdictions, and generally includes premeditated murder, murder by a specified means, and serious felony murders. Premeditated murder is typically a killing supported by specific intent to kill combined with cool reflection and planning. Murder by a specified means is killing with a specific heinous method. Felony murder is a homicide that occurs during the commission or attempted commission of a felony. Felony murder lacks murder intent; the defendant need only possess the intent required for the felony. Felony murder can be graded as first, second, or third degree, depending on the felony. The Model Penal Code classifies all murders as first-degree felonies.</p>
        <p class="para" id="storm_1.0-ch09_s07_p04">Second-degree murder is often defined as any murder that is not first degree. Typically, second-degree murder intent is the intent to inflict serious bodily injury or a depraved heart intent. Second-degree murder is usually graded lower than first-degree murder but higher than manslaughter.</p>
        <p class="para" id="storm_1.0-ch09_s07_p05">In many jurisdictions, manslaughter is an unlawful killing without murder intent. Most jurisdictions divide manslaughter into voluntary and involuntary. The Model Penal Code classifies all manslaughters as felonies of the second degree. Voluntary manslaughter is a killing that occurs during a heat of passion inspired by adequate provocation from the victim, negating murder intent. Involuntary manslaughter can be a killing that occurs during the commission or attempted commission of a misdemeanor or a reckless or negligent killing, depending on the jurisdiction. Involuntary manslaughter can also be vehicular manslaughter when the killing occurs while driving a vehicle recklessly, negligently, or under the influence of alcohol or drugs. The Model Penal Code classifies negligent killings as negligent homicide and a felony of the third degree.</p>

            <li>This killing could be first-degree <strong class="emphasis bold">premeditated murder</strong> or first-degree <strong class="emphasis bold">murder by a specified means</strong>. The facts indicate a willful, deliberate, premeditated killing. Johnnie evidences a specific intent to kill the leader of a rival gang. He indicates planning by putting his gun in the glove compartment of his car and driving to the gas station on Friday night where he suspects Marcus will be present. He kills Marcus by shooting him in a manner calculated to cause death. In addition, first-degree murder by a specified means frequently includes drive-by shooting as a method of killing.</li>

        <ol class="orderedlist" id="storm_1.0-ch09_s07_l11">
            <li>The Model Penal Code classifies criminal homicides as felonies of the first, second, and third degree, depending on the defendant’s intent. Murder is supported by purposeful, knowing, or extremely reckless intent and is a felony of the first degree. Manslaughter is supported by reckless intent, or is a murder that is committed under the influence of extreme mental or emotional disturbance for which there is a reasonable explanation or excuse, and is a felony of the second degree. Criminal homicide committed with negligent intent is a negligent homicide and is a felony of the third degree.</li>
            <li>The Indiana Supreme Court held that a jury instruction on voluntary manslaughter was inappropriate because a reasonable person would not be provoked by words alone. In this case, a ten-year-old boy threatened to expose sexual molestation by the defendant, who was twenty years old. The Court held that this threat was not <strong class="emphasis bold">adequate provocation</strong>.</li>
            <li>The Maryland Court of Appeals held that <em class="emphasis">the victim</em> must be the source of the adequate provocation in a voluntary manslaughter case.

            <li>The defendant was charged with involuntary manslaughter because she treated her daughter’s meningitis with prayer, rather than obtaining medical care.

        <h3 class="title">Answer to Law and Ethics Question</h3>
        <ol class="orderedlist" id="storm_1.0-ch09_s07_l12">
            <li>The first problem with extending the defense of voluntary manslaughter to the deliberate killing of an abortion doctor is the fact that the abortion doctor is acting <em class="emphasis">legally</em>. Extending the defense in this manner opens the door to a voluntary manslaughter charge for a defendant who (1) kills an individual authorized to execute prisoners pursuant to the death penalty or (2) is a soldier who is going off to war. Another problem with extending the defense to include Roeder’s conduct is the lack of imminence. As discussed in <a class="xref" href="storm_1.0-ch05#storm_1.0-ch05">Chapter 5 "Criminal Defenses, Part 1"</a>, defense of others requires an <strong class="emphasis bold">imminent</strong> threat. No imminent threat was present when the abortion doctor was in church. Removing the imminence requirement allows defendants to calmly and with deliberation kill victims and thereafter claim voluntary manslaughter—the <em class="emphasis">antithesis</em> of heat of passion.

            <li>The California Supreme Court <strong class="emphasis bold">reversed</strong>, holding that implied malice does not mean that the defendant needs to be aware of the risk to a <em class="emphasis">specific victim</em>.</li>
            <li>The Supreme Court of North Carolina <strong class="emphasis bold">affirmed</strong> because there is no need to prove specific intent to kill when a murder is by a specified means.</li>
            <li>The Supreme Court of Georgia <strong class="emphasis bold">affirmed</strong> because the defendant voluntarily and knowingly took the victim into his home and agreed to care for her, creating the duty to act.</li>
