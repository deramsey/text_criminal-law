        <p class="para editable block" id="storm_1.0-ch04_s01_s01_p01">Janine gets into a fight with her boyfriend Conrad after the senior prom. She grabs Conrad’s car keys out of his hand, jumps into his car, and locks all the doors. When Conrad strides over to the car, she starts the engine, puts the car into drive, and tries to run him down. It is dark and difficult for Janine to see, so Conrad easily gets out of her way and is unharmed. However, Janine is thereafter arrested and charged with attempted murder. In this case, the prosecution has to prove the elements of <strong class="emphasis bold">criminal act</strong>, <strong class="emphasis bold">criminal intent</strong>, and <strong class="emphasis bold">concurrence</strong> for attempted murder. The prosecution does <em class="emphasis">not</em> have to prove <strong class="emphasis bold">causation</strong> or that Conrad was <strong class="emphasis bold">harmed</strong> because attempt crimes, including attempted murder, do not have a bad result requirement.

            <p class="para editable block" id="storm_1.0-ch04_s01_s02_s01_p01">One requirement of criminal act is that the defendant perform it <em class="emphasis">voluntarily</em>. In other words, the defendant must <em class="emphasis">control</em> the act. It would not serve the policy of specific deterrence to punish the defendant for irrepressible acts. The Model Penal Code gives the following examples of acts that are not voluntary and, therefore, not criminal: reflexes, convulsions, bodily movements during unconsciousness or sleep, conduct during hypnosis or resulting from hypnotic suggestion, or a bodily movement that otherwise is not a product of the effort or determination of the actor, either conscious or habitual (Model Penal Code § 2.01 (2)). <em class="emphasis">One voluntary act</em> is enough to fulfill the voluntary act requirement. Thus if a <em class="emphasis">voluntary</em> act is followed by an <em class="emphasis">involuntary</em> one, the court may still impose criminal liability depending on the circumstances.<span class="footnote" id="storm_1.0-fn04_002"><em class="emphasis">Govt. of Virgin Islands v.

Smashing a pie into a person’s face is probably <em class="emphasis">battery</em> in most states, but Perry did not commit the act <em class="emphasis">voluntarily</em>, so he should not be convicted of a crime. Punishing Perry for battery would not specifically deter Perry from performing the act again while hypnotized because he is not in control of his behavior when experiencing this mental state.</p>

A punishment in this instance could <em class="emphasis">specifically deter</em> Timothy from drinking and driving on another occasion and is appropriate based on the circumstances.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Status as a Criminal Act</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="storm_1.0-ch04_s01_s03_p01">Generally, a defendant’s <strong class="emphasis bold">status</strong> in society is not a criminal act. Status is <em class="emphasis">who</em> the defendant is, not what the defendant <em class="emphasis">does</em>. Similar to punishment for an involuntary act, when the government punishes an individual for status, it is essentially targeting that individual for circumstances that are outside his or her control. This punishment may be cruel and unusual pursuant to the Eighth Amendment if it is disproportionate to the defendant’s behavior.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="storm_1.0-ch04_s01_s03_p02">In <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=3358010003227436496&amp;q=Robinson+v.+California&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2,5"><em class="emphasis">Robinson v. California</em></a>, 370 U.S. 660 (1962), the US Supreme Court held that it is unconstitutional as cruel and unusual punishment pursuant to the Eighth Amendment to punish an individual for the <strong class="emphasis bold">status</strong> of being a drug addict—even if the drugs to which the defendant is addicted are <em class="emphasis">illegal</em>. The Court compared drug addiction to an illness, such as leprosy or venereal disease. Punishing a defendant for being sick not only is inhumane but also does <em class="emphasis">not</em> specifically deter, similar to a punishment for an involuntary act.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="storm_1.0-ch04_s01_s03_p03">If the defendant can control the actions at issue in spite of his or her status, the defendant’s conduct can be constitutionally criminalized and punished pursuant to the Eighth Amendment.

Texas</em></a>, 392 U.S. 514 (1968), the US Supreme Court upheld the defendant’s conviction for “drunk in public,” in spite of the defendant’s status as an alcoholic. The Court held that it is difficult <em class="emphasis">but not impossible</em> for an alcoholic to resist the urge to drink, so the behavior the statute criminalized was voluntary. Also, the Court ruled that the state has an interest in treating alcoholism and preventing alcohol-related crimes that could injure the defendant and others. Pursuant to <em class="emphasis">Powell</em>, statutes that criminalize <em class="emphasis">voluntary acts</em> that <em class="emphasis">arise</em> from status are constitutional under the Eighth Amendment.</p>

            <h2 class="title editable block">Example of a Constitutional Statute Related to Status</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="storm_1.0-ch04_s01_s03_s01_p01">Refer to the example in <a class="xref" href="#storm_1.0-ch04_s01_s02_s01_s02">Section 4 "Example of a Voluntary Act Followed by a Nonvoluntary Act"</a>, where Timothy drives under the influence of alcohol and kills another. A state statute that criminalizes killing another person while driving under the influence is constitutional as applied to Timothy, even if Timothy is an alcoholic. The state has an interest in treating alcoholism and preventing alcohol-related crimes that could injure or kill Timothy or another person. Timothy’s act of driving while intoxicated is <em class="emphasis">voluntary</em>, even if his status as an alcoholic makes it more difficult for Timothy to control his drinking. Thus Timothy and other alcoholic defendants can be prosecuted and punished for killing another person while driving under the influence without violating the Eighth Amendment.</p>

Brianna writes her thoughts in a diary, documenting how she intends to rig the gas line so that gas is pumped into the house all night while Phoebe is sleeping. Brianna includes the date that she wants to kill Phoebe in her most recent diary entry. As Brianna leaves Phoebe’s house, her diary accidentally falls out of her purse. Later, Phoebe finds the diary on the floor and reads it. Phoebe calls the police, gives them Brianna’s diary, and insists they arrest Brianna for attempted murder. Although Brianna’s murder plot is sinister and is documented in her diary, an arrest is improper in this case. Brianna cannot be punished for her <em class="emphasis">thoughts alone</em>. If Brianna took substantial steps toward killing Phoebe, an attempted murder charge might be appropriate. However, at this stage, Brianna is only <em class="emphasis">planning</em> a crime, not <em class="emphasis">committing</em> a crime. Phoebe may be able to go to court and get a restraining order against Brianna to prevent her from carrying out her murder plot, but Brianna cannot be incapacitated by arrest and prosecution for attempted murder in this case.</p>

Keep in mind that <em class="emphasis">experts</em> who are <em class="emphasis">not</em> contractually bound can ignore an individual’s pleas for help without committing a crime, no matter how morally abhorrent that may seem.

            <p class="para editable block" id="storm_1.0-ch04_s01_s05_s03_p01">A special relationship may also be the basis of a legal duty to act. The most common special relationships are parent-child, spouse-spouse, and employer-employee. Often, the rationale for creating a legal duty to act when people are in a special relationship is the <em class="emphasis">dependence</em> of one individual on another. A parent has the obligation by law to provide food, clothing, shelter, and medical care for his or her children, because children are dependent on their parents and do not have the ability to procure these items themselves. In addition, if someone puts another person <em class="emphasis">in peril</em>, there may be a duty to <em class="emphasis">rescue</em> that person.<span class="footnote" id="storm_1.0-fn04_008"><em class="emphasis">State ex rel. Kuntz v. Thirteenth Jud.

On a related note, some jurisdictions also impose a duty to <em class="emphasis">continue to provide aid</em>, once aid or assistance has started.<span class="footnote" id="storm_1.0-fn04_009"><em class="emphasis">Jones v.

Under a theory of vicarious liability, the defendant does not need to commit the criminal act supported by criminal intent. The defendant just has to be involved with the criminal actor in a legally defined relationship. As in civil law, vicarious liability is common between employers and employees.</p>

Certain statutes could <em class="emphasis">subject Don</em> to criminal prosecution for selling alcohol to an underage person like Ashley, even though Don did not <em class="emphasis">personally</em> participate in the sale.

                <ul class="itemizedlist" id="storm_1.0-ch04_s02_s07_s01_l01">
                    <li>One important function of intent is the determination of punishment. In general, the more evil the intent, the more severe the punishment.</li>
                    <li>The three common-law intents ranked in order of culpability are malice aforethought, specific intent, and general intent.</li>
                    <li>Specific intent is the intent to bring about a certain result, do something other than the criminal act, or scienter. General intent is simply the intent to perform the criminal act.</li>
                    <li>With a general intent crime, the trier of fact may infer intent from the criminal act. This alleviates the prosecution’s burden of proving criminal intent.</li>
                    <li>Motive is the reason the defendant commits the criminal act. Motive standing alone is not enough to prove criminal intent.</li>
                    <li>The Model Penal Code’s criminal states of mind ranked in order of culpability are purposely, knowingly, recklessly, and negligently. Purposely is similar to specific intent to cause a particular result. Knowingly is awareness that results are practically certain to occur. Recklessly is a subjective awareness of a risk of harm, and an objective and unjustified disregard of that risk. Negligently is not being aware of a substantial risk of harm when a reasonable person would be.</li>
                    <li>The exception to the requirement that every crime contain a criminal intent element is strict liability.</li>
                    <li>Transferred intent promotes justice by holding a defendant responsible for his or her criminal conduct, even though the conduct was intended to harm a different victim.</li>
                    <li>Vicarious liability is the transfer of criminal liability from one criminal defendant to another based on a special relationship.</li>
                    <li>Concurrence requires that act and intent exist at the same moment.</li>

In <em class="emphasis">Crosby</em>, the defendant was convicted of manslaughter of a dependent person by neglect. The defendant’s mother died of “sepsis” and was brought to the hospital covered with feces and bedsores. The defendant was her mother’s caregiver. The jury was instructed that the defendant possessed the mental state of “recklessness” under the statute if she disregarded a substantial risk of <strong class="emphasis bold">harm</strong> or <strong class="emphasis bold">circumstances</strong>. The jury asked the judge if “circumstances” included the <em class="emphasis">bedsores</em> or <em class="emphasis">just death</em>.

                <p class="para" id="storm_1.0-ch04_s02_s07_s01_p04">In <em class="emphasis">Dean</em>, the defendant was sentenced to ten years imprisonment under a federal sentencing enhancement for an accidental discharge of his firearm during a bank robbery. The prosecution presented evidence at trial indicating that the defendant went into the bank wearing a mask and carrying a loaded firearm. The defendant told everyone in the bank to “get down,” and then went behind the tellers’ station and began grabbing money with his left hand. The gun in his right hand discharged. The defendant seemed surprised by the discharge, cursed, and ran out of the bank. No one was injured or hurt during the robbery.</p>
                <p class="para" id="storm_1.0-ch04_s02_s07_s01_p05">The defendant thereafter admitted he committed the robbery. The US Supreme Court upheld the defendant’s sentencing, in spite of the fact that there was <em class="emphasis">no</em> evidence of <em class="emphasis">intent</em> to discharge the firearm. The Court based its holding on the plain meaning of the statute requiring a minimum sentence of ten years imprisonment when a firearm is discharged during a robbery. The statute, 18 U.S.C. § 924(c) (1) (A), does not expressly state a criminal intent requirement. The Court further held that a presumption of criminal intent was not required. As the Court stated, “[i]t is unusual to impose criminal punishment for the consequences of purely accidental conduct. But it is not unusual to punish individuals for the unintended consequences of their <em class="emphasis">unlawful</em> acts” (<em class="emphasis">Dean v. U.S.</em>, 129 S.

        <p class="para editable block" id="storm_1.0-ch04_s03_s02_p01">It is the second part of the analysis that ensures fairness in the application of the causation element. The defendant must also be the <strong class="emphasis bold">legal</strong> or <strong class="emphasis bold">proximate cause</strong> of the harm. Proximate means “near,” so the defendant’s conduct must be closely related to the harm it engenders. As the Model Penal Code states, the actual result cannot be “too remote or accidental in its occurrence to have a [just] bearing on the actor’s liability” (Model Penal Code § 2.03 (2) (b)).</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="storm_1.0-ch04_s03_s02_p02">The test for legal causation is objective foreseeability.<span class="footnote" id="storm_1.0-fn04_027">California Criminal Jury Instructions No. 520, accessed February 14, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.justia.com/criminal/docs/calcrim/500/520.html">http://www.justia.com/criminal/docs/calcrim/500/520.html</a>.</span> The trier of fact must be convinced that when the defendant acted, a <em class="emphasis">reasonable person</em> could have <em class="emphasis">foreseen</em> or predicted that the end result would occur. In the example given in <a class="xref" href="#storm_1.0-ch04_s03_s01_s01">Section 4 "Example of Factual Cause"</a>, Henry is not the legal cause of Mary’s death because a reasonable person could have neither foreseen nor predicted that a shove would push Mary into a spot where lightning was about to strike.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="storm_1.0-ch04_s03_s02_p03">The Model Penal Code adjusts the legal causation foreseeability requirement depending on whether the defendant acted purposely, knowingly, recklessly, or negligently.

Mary staggers backward into the entertainment center and it crashes down on top of her, killing her. In this situation, Henry is the factual cause of Mary’s death because he started the chain of events that led to her death with his push.

        <p class="para editable block" id="storm_1.0-ch04_s03_s04_p02">Some states have either a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">one year and a day rule</a><span class="glossdef">The victim must die within one year and a day of the defendant’s criminal act, or the defendant will not be the legal cause of death.</span></span> or a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">three years and a day rule</a><span class="glossdef">The victim must die within three years and a day of the defendant’s criminal act, or the defendant will not be the legal cause of death.</span></span>.<span class="footnote" id="storm_1.0-fn04_029">S.C.

                <li>Phillipa sees Fred picking up trash along the highway and decides she wants to frighten him. She drives a quarter of a mile ahead of Fred and parks her car. She then hides in the bushes and waits for Fred to show up. When Fred gets close enough, she jumps out of the bushes screaming. Frightened, Fred drops his trash bag and runs into the middle of the highway where he is struck by a vehicle and killed. Is Phillipa’s act the <strong class="emphasis bold">legal cause</strong> of Fred’s death? Why or why not?</li>
                <li>Read <em class="emphasis">Bullock v. State</em>, 775 A.2d. 1043 (2001). In <em class="emphasis">Bullock</em>, the defendant was convicted of manslaughter based on a vehicle collision that occurred when his vehicle hit the victim’s vehicle in an intersection. The defendant was under the influence of alcohol and traveling thirty miles per hour over the speed limit. The victim was in the intersection <em class="emphasis">unlawfully</em> because the light was red. The defendant claimed that the victim was the <strong class="emphasis bold">intervening superseding cause</strong> of her own death. Did the Supreme Court of Delaware agree?

        <h3 class="title">Summary</h3>
        <p class="para" id="storm_1.0-ch04_s04_p01">Crimes are made up of parts, referred to as elements. The criminal elements are criminal act or actus reus, criminal intent or mens rea, concurrence, causation, harm, and attendant circumstances. Only crimes that specify a bad result require the causation and harm elements.</p>
        <p class="para" id="storm_1.0-ch04_s04_p02">Criminal acts must be voluntary or controllable and cannot consist solely of the defendant’s status or thoughts. Just one voluntary act is needed for a crime, so if a voluntary act is followed by an involuntary act, the defendant can still be criminally responsible. Omission or failure to act can also be criminal if there is a duty to act based on a statute, contract, or special relationship. Possession is passive, but it can still be a criminal act. The most common items that are criminal to possess are illegal contraband, drugs, and weapons. Possession can be actual if the item is on or very near the defendant’s person, or constructive if within an area of the defendant’s control, like inside the defendant’s house or vehicle. More than one defendant can be in possession of one item. Criminal possession should be supported by the intent of awareness because it is passive.</p>
        <p class="para" id="storm_1.0-ch04_s04_p03">Criminal intent is an important element because it is often one factor considered in the grading of criminal offenses. The three common-law criminal intents are malice aforethought, which is intent to kill, specific intent, and general intent. Specific intent is the intent to bring about a particular result, a higher level of awareness than is required to perform the criminal act, or scienter, which is knowledge that a criminal act is unlawful. General intent is the intent to do the act and can often give rise to an inference of criminal intent from proof of the criminal act. Motive should not be confused with or replace intent. Motive is the reason the defendant develops criminal intent.</p>
        <p class="para" id="storm_1.0-ch04_s04_p04">The Model Penal Code describes four criminal states of mind, which are purposely, knowingly, recklessly, and negligently. Purposely is similar to specific intent to cause a particular result. Knowingly is awareness that results are practically certain to occur. Recklessly is a subjective awareness of a risk of harm and an objective and unjustified disregard of that risk. Negligently is not being aware of a substantial risk of harm when a reasonable person would be. Offense elements, including specified attendant circumstances, may require different mental states. If so, the prosecution must prove each mental state for every element beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>
        <p class="para" id="storm_1.0-ch04_s04_p05">Strict liability crimes do not require an intent element and are generally malum prohibitum, with a less severe punishment. Transferred intent is a legal fiction that transfers a defendant’s criminal intent to an unintended victim for the purpose of fairness. Pursuant to transferred intent, the defendant may be responsible for two crimes: attempt and the completed crime, depending on the circumstances. Vicarious liability transfers a defendant’s criminal liability to a different defendant based on a special relationship. Corporate liability is a type of vicarious liability that holds a corporation responsible for crimes apart from its owners, agents, and employees. Concurrence is also a criminal element that requires the criminal act and criminal intent exist at the same moment.</p>
        <p class="para" id="storm_1.0-ch04_s04_p06">When the crime requires a bad result, the defendant must cause the harm. The defendant must be the factual and legal cause. Factual cause means that the defendant starts the chain of events that leads to the bad result. Legal or proximate cause means that it is objectively foreseeable that the end result will occur when the defendant commits the criminal act. An intervening superseding cause breaks the chain of events started by the defendant’s criminal act and insulates the defendant from criminal liability. When the intervening superseding cause is an individual, the intervening individual is criminally responsible for the crime. Some states have rules that protect the defendant from criminal responsibility for homicide when the victim lives a long time after the criminal act. These death timeline rules require the victim to die within one or three years and a day from the defendant’s criminal act and are becoming increasingly unpopular. Many states have abolished death timeline rules in favor of ordinary principles of legal causation.</p>

            <li>The Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court upheld the defendant’s indictment, and did not create a new death timeline rule.</li>

            <li>Although ten years is a lengthy prison sentence, it may be ethical even for a criminal act committed without criminal <em class="emphasis">intent</em> if there is a potential for <strong class="emphasis bold">harm</strong>. In <em class="emphasis">Dean</em>, the defendant may have discharged the firearm unintentionally, but there was a great potential for injury. The defendant was inside a bank filled with employees and customers. Although the defendant’s shot did not cause physical injury to any of the bank’s occupants, this was mere happenstance. The defendant could have shot and killed someone. If a security guard was startled by the gunshot, a shootout may have occurred, injuring many more individuals. Thus punishing a defendant for an act that lacks criminal intent (and harm) could fulfill <strong class="emphasis bold">specific</strong> and <strong class="emphasis bold">general deterrence</strong>. Criminal intent and harm are only two factors to be considered when grading crimes. If other purposes of punishment are applicable, they can also be considered as factors.</li>

            <li>The Court of Appeals of North Carolina held that the defendant was criminally responsible for hitting his wife’s friend under a theory of <em class="emphasis">transferred intent</em>. Thus this is an issue of <strong class="emphasis bold">criminal intent</strong>. The Court of Appeals held that transferred intent applies even when the defendant injures the <em class="emphasis">intended</em> victim.</li>
            <li>The Court of Appeals of Ohio held that the defendant did not <em class="emphasis">choose</em> to bring drugs to the jail; the police forcibly took him there. Thus there was no voluntary <strong class="emphasis bold">criminal act</strong>.</li>
            <li>The District of Columbia Court of Appeals affirmed the defendant’s conviction, holding that the animal cruelty statute required proof of <em class="emphasis">general intent plus malice</em>, which the defendant demonstrated with his beating of the puppy. Thus this is an issue of <strong class="emphasis bold">criminal intent</strong>.</li>
            <li>The Court of Appeals of Arizona held that the statutes the defendant violated are <em class="emphasis">strict liability</em>, so the fact that the defendant may have been mistaken as to the limited location authorized by his hunting permit is <em class="emphasis">irrelevant</em>. Thus this is an issue of <strong class="emphasis bold">criminal intent</strong>.</li>
