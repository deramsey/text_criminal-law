        <h2 class="title editable block">Synopsis of the History of Homicide</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="storm_1.0-ch09_s01_s01_p01">Homicide is the killing of one human being by another. Homicide is not always criminal. For example, a lawful execution pursuant to the death penalty is <em class="emphasis">homicide</em>, but it is not <em class="emphasis">criminal</em> homicide.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="storm_1.0-ch09_s01_s01_p02">Homicide law in the United States has its origins in the English common law. Oxford professor Sir William Blackstone defined homicide as justifiable, excusable, or felonious. Justifiable homicides were not criminal because they did not include the concept of guilt. Excusable homicides were not criminal because they included minimal guilt. Felonious homicides were criminal and were considered the most heinous offenses known to man.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="storm_1.0-ch09_s01_s01_p03">Initially at common law, every felonious or criminal homicide was punished by death. Gradually, as the law evolved, unlawful killings were divided into murder and manslaughter based on the defendant’s criminal <em class="emphasis">intent</em>. Murder had the criminal intent element of malice aforethought and remained a capital offense. Manslaughter was an unlawful killing without malice and was punished by incarceration.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="storm_1.0-ch09_s01_s01_p04">In modern times, most states define criminal homicide and its elements in <em class="emphasis">statutes</em>, which often are interpreted by case law. Many jurisdictions continue to follow Blackstone’s philosophy and the common-law division between murder and manslaughter, as is discussed in this chapter.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Corpus Delicti in Criminal Homicide</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="storm_1.0-ch09_s01_s02_p01">An essential component of <em class="emphasis">every</em> criminal case, including criminal homicide, is <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">corpus delicti</a><span class="glossdef">The substance of the case.</span></span>. Corpus delicti is the substance of the crime at issue. The prosecution must prove corpus delicti beyond a reasonable doubt, with evidence <em class="emphasis">other than a defendant’s confession</em>.<span class="footnote" id="storm_1.0-fn09_001"><em class="emphasis">People v. Ochoa</em>, 966 P.2d 442 (1998), accessed February 13, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=13299597995178567741&amp;q=corpus+delicti+criminal+homicide&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2,5">http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=13299597995178567741&amp;q= corpus+delicti+criminal+homicide&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2,5</a>.</span> Although a detailed discussion of corpus delicti is beyond the scope of this text, corpus delicti in a criminal homicide case consists of the death of a victim, caused by the defendant, in an unlawful manner.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="storm_1.0-ch09_s01_s02_p02">Often the victim’s body is never discovered, which could make it more difficult for the prosecution to prove corpus delicti but not impossible. If there is sufficient circumstantial or direct evidence, such as bloodstains, surveillance footage, or witness testimony, the prosecution can prove corpus delicti without the victim’s body and can convict the defendant of criminal homicide.</p>

The modern trend in many jurisdictions is to include the fetus as a victim in a criminal homicide or feticide statute, excepting <em class="emphasis">abortion</em>. The definition of fetus is either set forth in the criminal homicide or feticide statute or created by case law. Many states and the federal government consider an embryo a fetus from the time of conception.<span class="footnote" id="storm_1.0-fn09_003">Ala.
