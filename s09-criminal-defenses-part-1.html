        <p class="para editable block" id="storm_1.0-ch05_s01_s01_p01">Defenses can be categorized as denial or failure of proof, affirmative, imperfect, or perfect. Defenses can also be categorized as factual, legal, based on justification, or excuse.

In certain cases, the defendant can either <em class="emphasis">deny</em> that a criminal element(s) exists or simply sit back and wait for the prosecution to fail in meeting its burden of proof. This legal strategy is sometimes referred to as either a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">denial or failure of proof defense</a><span class="glossdef">The defendant denies that an element of the offense exists and prevents the prosecution from meeting its burden of proof.</span></span>.</p>

When the defendant asserts an affirmative defense, the defendant raises a <em class="emphasis">new</em> issue that must be proven to a certain evidentiary standard. State statutes often specify whether a defense is affirmative. The Model Penal Code defines an affirmative defense as a defense that is deemed affirmative in the Code or a separate statute, or that “involves a matter of excuse or justification peculiarly within the knowledge of the defendant” (Model Penal Code § 1.12 (3) (c)). Procedurally, the defendant must assert any affirmative defense before or during the trial, or the defense cannot be used as grounds for an appeal.</p>

Defendants who commit criminal homicide justified by self-defense can be acquitted, or have a murder charge reduced from first to second or third degree, or have a charge reduced from murder to manslaughter. Criminal homicide is discussed in detail in <a class="xref" href="storm_1.0-ch09#storm_1.0-ch09">Chapter 9 "Criminal Homicide"</a>.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="storm_1.0-ch05_s02_p04">To successfully claim self-defense, the defendant must prove four elements. First, with exceptions, the defendant must prove that he or she was confronted with an <strong class="emphasis bold">unprovoked</strong> attack. Second, the defendant must prove that the threat of injury or death was <strong class="emphasis bold">imminent</strong>. Third, the defendant must prove that the <strong class="emphasis bold">degree of force</strong> used in self-defense was objectively reasonable under the circumstances. Fourth, the defendant must prove that he or she had an <strong class="emphasis bold">objectively reasonable fear</strong> that he or she was going to be injured or killed unless he or she used self-defense. The Model Penal Code defines self-defense in § 3.04(1) as “justifiable when the actor believes that such force is immediately necessary for the purpose of protecting himself against the use of unlawful force by such other person on the present occasion.”</p>

                <ul class="itemizedlist" id="storm_1.0-ch05_s02_s04_s02_l01">
                    <li>Self-defense is a defense based on justification that allows a defendant to use physical force to protect himself or herself from injury or death.</li>
                    <li>Deadly force is any force that can produce death. An individual does not have to die for the force to be deemed deadly.</li>
                    <li>Four elements are required for self-defense: (1) an unprovoked attack, (2) which threatens imminent injury or death, and (3) an objectively reasonable degree of force, used in response to (4) an objectively reasonable fear of injury or death.</li>
                    <li>Two exceptions to the unprovoked attack rule are an individual’s use of excessive force in response to an initial attack and the defendant’s withdrawal from the initial attack.</li>
                    <li>The battered wife defense asserts that a woman who is a victim of spousal abuse may use force in self-defense under certain circumstances, even when the threat of harm is not immediate. The battered wife defense is justified with respect to the imminence requirement: because the abuse is so constant, the battered wife faces an imminent threat every day.</li>
                    <li>Deadly force is appropriate in self-defense when the attacker threatens death, serious bodily injury, and, in some jurisdictions, a serious felony.</li>
                    <li>The duty to retreat doctrine is a common-law rule requiring a defendant to retreat if it is safe to do so, instead of using deadly force in self-defense. The stand-your-ground doctrine is a rule allowing the defendant to use deadly force if appropriate in self-defense, rather than retreating.</li>
                    <li>Imperfect self-defense is a defense available when the defendant has an honest but unreasonable belief that force is necessary to defend against injury or death. Imperfect self-defense reduces the severity of the offense, but does not result in acquittal.</li>

Kelsey has probably used <em class="emphasis">reasonable</em> force under the circumstances and can claim defense of property as a defense to battery. If Keith testifies that he was simply going to hand Kelsey the key, which she left in the house, the attack could still be justified if the trier of fact determines that it was <em class="emphasis">objectively reasonable</em> for Kelsey to believe Keith was about to damage her property. In jurisdictions that follow the Model Penal Code, Kelsey can probably use defense of property as a defense to battery because it is clear <em class="emphasis">Kelsey</em> believed that force was immediately necessary to protect her personal property in this situation. Of course, if Kelsey pulls out a gun and shoots Keith, she could not claim defense of property because deadly force is never justifiable to protect real or personal property from harm.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Use of Force in Arrest and Apprehension of Criminal Suspects</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="storm_1.0-ch05_s03_s04_p01">Occasionally, law enforcement must use <em class="emphasis">force</em> to effectuate an arrest or apprehend a criminal suspect. The <em class="emphasis">appropriate</em> use of force during an arrest or apprehension can operate as a defense to assault, battery, false imprisonment, kidnapping, and criminal homicide. At early common law, law enforcement could use reasonable, nondeadly force to arrest an individual for a misdemeanor and reasonable, even deadly force, to arrest an individual for <em class="emphasis">any</em> felony. Modern law enforcement’s ability to use deadly force is governed by the US Constitution.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="storm_1.0-ch05_s03_s04_p02">The US Supreme Court clarified the constitutional standard for law enforcement’s use of deadly force in <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=5843997099226288287&amp;q=Tennessee+v.+Garner&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2,5"><em class="emphasis">Tennessee v. Garner</em></a>, 471 U.S. 1 (1985). In <em class="emphasis">Garner</em>, the Court invalidated a Tennessee statute that allowed law enforcement to exercise <em class="emphasis">any</em> degree of force to apprehend and arrest a fleeing felon. The law enforcement officer in <em class="emphasis">Garner</em> admitted that he shot and killed a suspect, reasonably believing he was <em class="emphasis">unarmed</em>. The Court held that the Fourth Amendment governed law enforcement’s use of deadly force in this situation because the use of deadly force is a <strong class="emphasis bold">seizure</strong>. Thus law enforcement’s use of deadly force must be scrutinized pursuant to the standard of constitutional <em class="emphasis">reasonableness</em>. According to the Court, the only constitutionally reasonable circumstances under which law enforcement can use deadly force to arrest or apprehend a fleeing felon is when law enforcement has probable cause to believe that the suspect poses a significant threat of death or serious physical injury to the officer or others.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="storm_1.0-ch05_s03_s04_p03">Currently, most jurisdictions have statutes protecting law enforcement’s reasonable use of force when effectuating an arrest or apprehending a fleeing suspect. Under <em class="emphasis">Garner</em>, these statutes must restrict the lawful use of deadly force to potentially deadly situations. If a law enforcement officer exceeds the use of force permitted under the circumstances, the law enforcement officer could be prosecuted for a <em class="emphasis">crime</em> or sued for <em class="emphasis">civil damages</em> (or both).</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="storm_1.0-ch05_s03_s04_s01_p01">Review the example in <a class="xref" href="storm_1.0-ch01#storm_1.0-ch01">Chapter 1 "Introduction to Criminal Law"</a>, <a class="xref" href="storm_1.0-ch01_s02#storm_1.0-ch01_s02_s01">Section 1.2.1 "Example of Criminal Law Issues"</a>. In that example, Linda puts a bra in her purse without paying for it at an expensive department store. When she attempts to leave the store, an alarm is activated. Linda begins sprinting down the street. Colin, a police officer, just happens to be driving by with the window of his patrol car open. He hears the store alarm, sees Linda running, and begins shooting at Linda from the car. Linda is shot in the leg and collapses. In this example, no facts exist to indicate that Linda poses a potentially <strong class="emphasis bold">deadly</strong> threat to Colin or others. The fact that Linda is running down the street and an alarm is going off does not demonstrate that Linda has committed a crime necessitating deadly force to arrest. Thus Colin can use only <strong class="emphasis bold">nondeadly</strong> force to arrest Linda, such as his hands, or possibly a stun gun or Taser to subdue her. If Linda is <em class="emphasis">unarmed</em> and Colin uses a firearm to subdue her, the utilization of deadly force is excessive under these circumstances and Colin has no defense to assault with a deadly weapon or to attempted murder.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="storm_1.0-ch05_s03_s04_s01_p02">Change this example and imagine that Colin pulls over and attempts to arrest Linda. Linda removes a gun from her purse. Under most modern statutes, Colin does not have a duty to retreat and can use deadly force to arrest or apprehend Linda. Under <em class="emphasis">Garner</em>, it is reasonable to believe that Linda poses a danger of death or serious bodily injury to Colin or others. Thus Colin can constitutionally use <strong class="emphasis bold">deadly force</strong> to protect himself and the public from harm in this situation. Note that Linda’s theft is probably a <em class="emphasis">misdemeanor</em>, not a <em class="emphasis">felony</em>. However, it is Linda’s exhibition of deadly force to resist arrest that triggers Colin’s deadly force response. Under these circumstances, Colin’s use of deadly force is justified and can operate as a legal defense in a criminal prosecution or civil suit for damages.</p>

                    <li>Defense of others has the same elements as self-defense: the individual defended must be facing an unprovoked, imminent attack, and the defendant must use a reasonable degree of force with a reasonable belief that force is necessary to repel the attack.</li>
                    <li>Real property is land and anything permanently attached to it. Personal property is any movable object.</li>
                    <li>The defendant can use nondeadly force to defend real or personal property if the defendant has an objectively reasonable belief that an imminent threat of damage, destruction, or theft will occur.</li>

                    <li>Only nondeadly force may be used to defend property; deadly force may be used to defend habitation.</li>
                    <li>The defendant can use deadly force to defend habitation under modern castle laws if an intruder enters occupied premises, and the defendant has an objectively reasonable belief that the intruder will seriously injure or kill the occupants.</li>
                    <li>Modern castle laws abolish the duty to retreat when inside the home, occasionally include a presumption that the defendant has an objectively reasonable belief the intruder is going to seriously injure or kill the occupants, and provide civil and criminal immunity from prosecution.</li>
                    <li>Use of deadly force by law enforcement is considered a seizure under the Fourth Amendment, so law enforcement cannot use deadly force to apprehend or arrest a criminal suspect unless there is probable cause to believe the suspect will inflict serious physical injury or death upon the officer or others.</li>

After wandering around for hours with the temperature dropping, Tamara finds a locked cabin. Tamara breaks a window and climbs inside. Once inside, Tamara prepares some canned chili, drinks tap water, and uses the telephone to call law enforcement. Tamara could probably plead and prove choice of evils as a defense to burglary and theft in many jurisdictions. Tamara was confronted with two harms: harm to her personal safety and well-being and harm to the real and personal property of another. The harm to Tamara’s health and safety is ranked <em class="emphasis">more severe</em> than the minimal harm to property. It is <em class="emphasis">objectively reasonable</em> to break into and enter a cabin and use some of the supplies inside to prevent <em class="emphasis">imminent</em> injury or death. Thus although Tamara committed burglary and theft in many jurisdictions, she did so with the reasonable belief that she was saving her own life. A trier of fact could find that the harm avoided by Tamara’s actions was greater than the harm caused by the burglary and theft, and Tamara could be acquitted, or have her sentence or crime reduced, depending on the jurisdiction.</p>

Keisha can successfully claim <strong class="emphasis bold">duress</strong> as a defense to any charge of theft. If Brian had pointed the gun at another client in line at the bank instead of Keisha, Keisha could still prevail using the duress defense because duress also applies when the threat of death or serious bodily injury is to <em class="emphasis">another</em> person.</p>

        <h3 class="title">Summary</h3>
        <p class="para" id="storm_1.0-ch05_s06_p01">Defenses can be denial or failure of proof, affirmative, imperfect, perfect, factual, legal, common law (created by case law), or statutory (created by a state or federal legislature). A denial or failure of proof defense creates doubt in one or more of the elements of the offense and prevents the prosecution from meeting its burden of proof. An affirmative defense raises an issue separate from the elements of the offense and must be asserted before or during the trial or it cannot serve as the basis for an appeal. Defendants have either the burden of production or the burden of production and persuasion to a preponderance of evidence for an affirmative defense. An imperfect defense reduces the severity of the offense, or sentence. A perfect defense results in an acquittal. A factual defense is grounded in the facts of the case, while a legal defense depends on a statute or common-law principle. An example of a factual defense is an alibi defense, which asserts that the defendant could not have committed the crime because he or she was somewhere else at the time the crime occurred. An example of a legal defense is expiration of the statute of limitations, which means it is too late to prosecute the defendant for the offense.</p>
        <p class="para" id="storm_1.0-ch05_s06_p02">Defenses can also be based on justification or excuse. A defense based on justification focuses on the offense and deems the conduct worthy of protection from criminal responsibility. A defense based on excuse focuses on the defendant and excuses his or her conduct under the circumstances.</p>
        <p class="para" id="storm_1.0-ch05_s06_p03">Self-defense justifies the defendant’s conduct in using physical force as protective. Self-defense is legal only when the defendant is faced with an unprovoked, imminent attack, and it is objectively reasonable that the degree of force used in response is necessary to avoid the attack. The defendant can be the initial aggressor and still use self-defense if the attacked individual uses too much force in response to the defendant’s attack or if the defendant withdraws from the attack and is still pursued by the attacked individual. The attack does not necessarily have to be imminent if the defendant is a battered wife. Deadly force is any force that can kill under the circumstances. Deadly force can be used in self-defense only if the defendant is faced with imminent death, serious bodily injury, or the commission of a serious felony. Some jurisdictions require the defendant to retreat before resorting to deadly force, while others allow the defendant to stand his or her ground.</p>
        <p class="para" id="storm_1.0-ch05_s06_p04">In most states, an individual can defend another to the same extent as self-defense. If a defendant is honestly but unreasonably mistaken about the fact that he or she needs to respond in self-defense or defense of others, imperfect self-defense or defense of others may be appropriate, depending on the jurisdiction. A defendant can also defend property using nondeadly force from an imminent threat of damage, loss, or theft. Real property is land and anything permanently attached to it, while personal property is any movable object. In many jurisdictions, a trespasser may be ejected from real property using nondeadly force after the trespasser has been requested to leave.</p>
        <p class="para" id="storm_1.0-ch05_s06_p05">Defense of habitation is distinct from defense of real property in most states. Modern laws called castle laws expand the use of force to defend habitation. Castle laws eliminate the duty to retreat when in the home and provide civil and criminal immunity from prosecution for the use of deadly force. Deadly force can be used against a trespasser who enters occupied premises without consent of the owner when there is an objectively reasonable belief that the occupants will be seriously injured or killed.</p>
        <p class="para" id="storm_1.0-ch05_s06_p06">Law enforcement can also use force to arrest or apprehend a criminal. If the force is deadly, it is considered a seizure under the Fourth Amendment and is scrutinized under an objectively reasonable standard.</p>
        <p class="para" id="storm_1.0-ch05_s06_p07">The defense of choice of evils (called the necessity defense in some jurisdictions) permits the defendant to commit a crime if the harm caused is less severe than harm that will occur if the crime is not committed. In general, criminal homicide cannot be defended by choice of evils. Duress, a closely related defense, can sanction the use of force when the defendant is imminently threatened with serious bodily injury or death. Like choice of evils, the degree of force used pursuant to duress should be nondeadly.</p>
        <p class="para" id="storm_1.0-ch05_s06_p08">The victim can also consent to the defendant’s conduct, creating a consent defense, as long as the consent is given knowingly and voluntarily, the conduct is sexual or occurs during a sporting event, and the conduct does not involve serious bodily injury or death.</p>

            <li>The defendant, a police officer, shot the victim twice after being summoned to the victim’s home by his wife. The victim was intoxicated and armed with two small steak knives.
