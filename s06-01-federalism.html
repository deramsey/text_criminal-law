Federalism, as set forth in the US Constitution, divides governmental power between the <em class="emphasis">federal government</em> and each of the <em class="emphasis">states</em>. This prevents a concentrated source of governmental power in one individual or small group of individuals. Because of federalism, the United States has one federal legal system, and each state has its own state legal system. Thus in the United States, a plethora of legal systems all operate harmoniously at the same time.</p>
    <div class="section" id="storm_1.0-ch02_s01_s01">
        <h2 class="title editable block">The Scope of Federal Law</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="storm_1.0-ch02_s01_s01_p01">The government’s power to regulate comes from the US Constitution. The <em class="emphasis">federal</em> government derives its authority to create law from Article I, § 8, which discusses federal Congress’s <em class="emphasis">exclusive</em> or <strong class="emphasis bold">delegated powers</strong>. These include the power to regulate currency and coin, establish a post office, promote science and art by regulating the rights to discoveries and writings, declare war and raise armies, conduct foreign affairs, regulate interstate and foreign commerce, and make laws necessary and proper to execute other powers expressly granted in the Constitution. Courts have interpreted the last two powers mentioned in the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">commerce clause</a><span class="glossdef">A clause in the Constitution that allows Congress to regulate commerce (economic activity) that crosses state lines.</span></span> and the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">necessary and proper clause</a><span class="glossdef">A clause in the Constitution that allows Congress to make laws necessary to carry out all powers listed in the Constitution.</span></span> to be the <em class="emphasis">broadest</em> sources of federal regulatory authority.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="storm_1.0-ch02_s01_s01_p02">To simplify and summarize precedent defining federal regulatory authority, federal laws are meant to regulate in two areas. First, federal laws regulate issues that concern the <em class="emphasis">country</em>, rather than just one city, county, or state. The federal government regulates in the area of foreign affairs, for example, because this affects the United States of America, not just one particular region. Second, federal laws regulate commerce, which is economic activity, that <em class="emphasis">crosses from state to state</em>. Some common examples are television broadcasts, the Internet, and any form of transportation such as the airlines.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="storm_1.0-ch02_s01_s01_s01_p01">The original intent was for the federal government to be a <em class="emphasis">limited</em> government, with the bulk of regulatory authority residing in the <em class="emphasis">states</em>. The only <em class="emphasis">crimes</em> Congress is specifically authorized to punish are piracies and felonies on the high seas, counterfeiting, and treason; however, case precedent has expanded the federal government’s power to enact criminal laws based on the commerce clause and the necessary and proper clause.<span class="footnote" id="storm_1.0-fn02_001"><em class="emphasis">McCulloch v. Maryland</em>, 17 U.S. (4 Wheat.) 316 (1819), accessed August 28, 2010, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/historics/USSC_CR_0017_0316_ZS.html">http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/historics/USSC_CR_0017_0316_ZS.html</a>.</span> Still, there must be <em class="emphasis">some</em> connection to an issue of national character and interstate commerce, or the federal government will overstep its authority. In general, federal criminal laws target conduct that occurs on federal property or conduct involving federal employees, currency, coin, treason, national security, rights secured by the Constitution, or commerce that crosses state lines. Currently, over five hundred crimes are listed in Part I, Title 18 of the United States Code, which codifies criminal laws for the federal government.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">The Scope of State Law</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="storm_1.0-ch02_s01_s02_p01">The US Constitution designates the states as the <em class="emphasis">primary regulatory authority</em>. This is clarified in the Tenth Amendment, which reads, “The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited to it by the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or the people.” State laws are also supposed to regulate in two areas. First, state laws regulate issues of a <em class="emphasis">local</em> character or concern. A state may regulate, for example, its water ownership and use because water can be scarce and is not generally provided to other states. Second, state laws regulate issues or things that remain within a state’s border. A state generally regulates, for example, the operation of a small business whose products are only sold locally and not shipped out of the state.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="storm_1.0-ch02_s01_s02_p02">Federal laws are <em class="emphasis">the same</em> in every state, but state laws <em class="emphasis">differ</em> from state to state. Something that is legal in one state may be illegal in another state. This inconsistency makes our system of federalism complicated for students (and lawyers). However, with a country as large and varied as the United States, it is sensible to allow each state to choose for itself which laws will be most suitable.</p>

            <h2 class="title editable block">State Criminal Laws</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="storm_1.0-ch02_s01_s02_s01_p01">The power to enact criminal laws belongs almost <em class="emphasis">exclusively</em> to the states. This is because of the Tenth Amendment, which vests in states a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">police power</a><span class="glossdef">The states’ power to regulate for citizens’ health, safety, and welfare, as set forth in the Tenth Amendment to the Constitution.</span></span> to provide for the health, safety, and welfare of state citizens. Approximately 90 percent of all criminal laws are state, rather than federal. Often, federal crimes are also state crimes and can be prosecuted and punished by both the state and federal government without violating the principle of double jeopardy.</p>
