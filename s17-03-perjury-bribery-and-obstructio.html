        <p class="para editable block" id="storm_1.0-ch13_s03_s01_p01">Witness testimony is important in a variety of settings. Juries depend on witness testimony to reach a fair and impartial verdict in civil and criminal trials, and grand juries depend on witness testimony to indict defendants for criminal conduct. Thus modern laws of <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">perjury</a><span class="glossdef">A false material statement made under oath in a judicial or official proceeding or in a certified writing with awareness of the falsity of the statement or the specific intent to deceive.</span></span> are calculated to ensure that witnesses testify truthfully so that justice can be done in each individual case.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="storm_1.0-ch13_s03_s01_p02">In the Middle Ages, the witnesses were the jurors, so the criminalization of false witness testimony did not occur until the sixteenth century when the idea of a trial by an impartial jury emerged. The first common-law prohibition against witness perjury criminalized <strong class="emphasis bold">false</strong> testimony, given under <strong class="emphasis bold">oath</strong>, in a <strong class="emphasis bold">judicial proceeding</strong>, about a <strong class="emphasis bold">material</strong> issue. This definition was also incorporated into early American common law.<span class="footnote" id="storm_1.0-fn13_033">“Perjury—Perjury at Common Law,” Jrank.org website, accessed May 5, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://law.jrank.org/pages/1632/Perjury-Perjury-at-common-law.html">http://law.jrank.org/pages/1632/Perjury-Perjury-at-common-law.html</a>.</span></p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="storm_1.0-ch13_s03_s01_s06_p01">Marcus is a witness in a civil suit for damages against Lindsay. Macy’s department store is suing Lindsay for the alleged theft of a diamond necklace. Marcus takes an oath sworn by the court commissioner. He thereafter testifies that he saw Lindsay try on the necklace and then walk out of the store without paying for it. When the Macy’s attorney asks Marcus what he was doing at Macy’s, Marcus responds that he was buying some jewelry as a gift for his wife. In actuality, Marcus was shopping for jewelry as a gift for his <em class="emphasis">girlfriend</em>. Marcus has probably not committed perjury in this case. Marcus is testifying as a witness in a <em class="emphasis">civil</em> rather than <em class="emphasis">criminal</em> trial, but this satisfies the perjury requirement that the testimony be offered during a <strong class="emphasis bold">judicial</strong> or <strong class="emphasis bold">official</strong> proceeding. Before testifying, Marcus took an oath that was administered by a court commissioner, also satisfying the perjury requirement that the defendant take an oath administered by someone with the <em class="emphasis">legal authority</em> or <em class="emphasis">authorization</em> to take evidence under oath. Marcus’s statement is <em class="emphasis">false</em>, and he made the statement with <strong class="emphasis bold">knowledge</strong> of its falsity, which satisfies the perjury criminal intent requirement. However, Marcus’s statement does not appear to be <strong class="emphasis bold">material</strong> to this judicial proceeding because the reason for Marcus’s presence at Macy’s will not affect the outcome of Lindsay’s civil theft trial (usually called the tort of conversion). Thus Marcus is probably not subject to prosecution for and conviction of perjury, based on his testimony in this case.</p>

Change this example so that Marcus testifies that he did <em class="emphasis">not</em> see Lindsay walk out of the Macy’s department store without paying for the necklace because he does not want to admit that he was shopping for jewelry to buy his girlfriend. Anthony, the Macy’s civil trial attorney, cross-examines Marcus, and forces him to admit that he saw Lindsay steal the necklace, and that he was <em class="emphasis">lying</em> previously. Marcus has most likely committed perjury in this example. Marcus made a <strong class="emphasis bold">false</strong> statement, under a validly administered <strong class="emphasis bold">oath</strong>, in a <strong class="emphasis bold">judicial</strong> proceeding, with <strong class="emphasis bold">knowledge</strong> of its falsity. Marcus’s statement was <strong class="emphasis bold">material</strong> because, if believed, it would have helped exonerate Lindsay in her civil case.

Marcus’s admission that he was lying is not a <strong class="emphasis bold">retraction</strong> that could serve as a defense because it was not made until the lie was about to be exposed. Thus all the elements of perjury appear to be present, and Marcus may be subject to prosecution for and conviction of this offense.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="storm_1.0-ch13_s03_s02_s02_p01">Isabel, a defendant on trial for perjury, notices the judge presiding in her case shopping at Macy’s department store. Isabel thereafter buys an expensive watch, has it wrapped, walks up to the judge, and offers it to him as a gift. Isabel has most likely committed bribery in this case. Although the judge did not accept Isabel’s “gift,” most states criminalize as bribery the <strong class="emphasis bold">offer</strong> of any benefit, so the act of bribery is complete when Isabel proffers the watch. In addition, based on these facts, Isabel’s connection to the judge is only through her perjury prosecution, so her act appears calculated to influence his decision in that case, especially because the watch is expensive and not merely a token. Note that a prosecutor is required to prove <em class="emphasis">beyond a reasonable doubt</em> Isabel’s <strong class="emphasis bold">specific intent</strong> or <strong class="emphasis bold">purposely</strong> or <strong class="emphasis bold">general intent</strong> or <strong class="emphasis bold">knowingly</strong> to enter into an agreement with the judge influencing his decision, which is challenging even under the obvious circumstances apparent in this case.</p>

            <ul class="itemizedlist" id="storm_1.0-ch13_s03_s04_l01">
                <li>Most jurisdictions define perjury as a false material statement (criminal act), made with specific intent or purposely to deceive, or the general intent or knowingly that the statement was false, in a judicial or official proceeding, or in a certified writing (attendant circumstance), under oath (attendant circumstance).</li>
                <li>The issues commonly encountered in any perjury prosecution are proving the validity of the oath, the defendant’s criminal intent, or the materiality of the false statement, and any requirement of corroborative evidence.</li>
                <li>Many jurisdictions provide a defense to perjury if the defendant retracts his or her false statement in the course of the same proceeding in which it was made before it becomes manifest that the falsification will be exposed.</li>
                <li>Perjury by inconsistent statements is when the defendant makes statements that are inconsistent (criminal act), in a judicial proceeding (attendant circumstance), after taking a validly administered oath (attendant circumstance). The prosecution does not need to prove which statement is false for this offense. Subornation of perjury is procuring another to commit perjury (criminal act), with specific intent or purposely, or general intent or knowingly, and factually and legally causing the resulting harm that perjury is actually committed.</li>
                <li>Perjury is generally graded as a felony, with a potential sentencing enhancement for committing perjury that causes another to be sentenced to prison or the death penalty. Subornation of perjury is also graded as a felony.</li>
                <li>Many criminal statutes define bribery as conferring, offering, agreeing to confer, or soliciting, accepting, or agreeing to accept, any benefit upon a public official (criminal act) with the specific intent or purposely, or the general intent or knowingly to form an agreement or understanding that the public official’s decision making will be influenced by the benefit. The crime of bribery is often extended to apply to persons other than public officials, such as employees, agents, or fiduciaries for the purpose of influencing the bribed individual’s on-the-job conduct, which is called commercial bribery. Bribery can also cover members of a state legislature, any judicial officer, juror, referee, umpire, or witness. The primary issue in a bribery prosecution is proving the defendant’s criminal intent to enter into an agreement that influences the bribed individual’s decision making. Bribery is typically graded as a felony, with enhancements for a bribe that is a large sum of money or bribery that results in incarceration for a felony, along with a disqualification from office.</li>
                <li>Some typical examples of obstruction of justice are as follows: giving false identification to a law enforcement officer, impersonating a law enforcement officer, refusing to aid a law enforcement officer when requested, giving false evidence, hiding or concealing oneself and refusing to give evidence, tampering with evidence, and tampering with a witness or juror. All these acts are generally supported by specific intent or purposely, or general intent or knowingly. Obstruction of justice is graded anywhere from a misdemeanor to a felony, depending on the offense.</li>

                <li>Susannah, a Hollywood movie star, is a witness in a civil personal injury case. Susannah saw a car accident and is subpoenaed to testify that the defendant was at fault. After the court commissioner administers an oath to tell the truth, Susannah takes the witness stand. She knows the case will generate significant publicity, so Susannah shaves ten years off of her age when asked routine background questions by the prosecutor. If Susannah is thereafter caught in this lie and prosecuted for <strong class="emphasis bold">perjury</strong>, what will be the primary issue in her perjury prosecution? How will this issue be resolved?</li>
                <li>Read <em class="emphasis">State v. Carr</em>, 172 Conn. 458 (1977). In this case, the defendant was convicted of bribery when he paid an undercover detective to refrain from investigating narcotics crimes in the area. The defendant appealed, claiming the jury should have been instructed on the lesser included offense of offering gifts to state police officers. Did the Supreme Court of Connecticut uphold the defendant’s bribery conviction? Why or why not?
