        <h2 class="title editable block">Consolidated Theft Statutes</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="storm_1.0-ch11_s01_s01_p01">Historically, nonviolent theft was broken down into three categories: <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">larceny</a><span class="glossdef">Theft of personal property by a physical taking.</span></span>, <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">embezzlement</a><span class="glossdef">Theft of real or personal property by conversion.</span></span>, and <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">false pretenses</a><span class="glossdef">Theft of real property, personal property, or services by a false representation of fact.</span></span>. The categories differ in the <strong class="emphasis bold">type of property</strong> that can be stolen and the <strong class="emphasis bold">method</strong> of stealing. Modern jurisdictions combine all three categories of nonviolent theft into one <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">consolidated theft statute</a><span class="glossdef">A statute that criminalizes theft by larceny, embezzlement, and false pretenses.</span></span>, with a uniform grading system largely dependent on the <em class="emphasis">value</em> of the stolen property. The Model Penal Code consolidates <em class="emphasis">all</em> nonviolent theft offenses, including receiving stolen property and extortion, under one grading system (Model Penal Code § 223.1). What follows is a discussion of theft as defined in modern consolidated theft statutes, making note of the traditional distinctions among the various theft categories when appropriate. Theft has the elements of criminal act, criminal intent, attendant circumstances, causation, and harm, as is discussed in this chapter.</p>
        <div class="section" id="storm_1.0-ch11_s01_s01_s01">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Consolidated Theft Act</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="storm_1.0-ch11_s01_s01_s01_p01">The <strong class="emphasis bold">criminal act</strong> element required under consolidated theft statutes is stealing <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">real property</a><span class="glossdef">Land and anything permanently attached to it.</span></span>, <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">personal property</a><span class="glossdef">Movable objects.</span></span>, or <strong class="emphasis bold">services</strong>. <strong class="emphasis bold">Real property</strong> is land and anything permanently attached to land, like a building. <strong class="emphasis bold">Personal property</strong> is any movable item. Personal property can be <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">tangible property</a><span class="glossdef">Property that can be touched or held.</span></span>, like money, jewelry, vehicles, electronics, cellular telephones, and clothing. Personal property can also be <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">intangible property</a><span class="glossdef">Property that has value but cannot be touched or held, for example, stocks and bonds.</span></span>, which means it has value, but it cannot be touched or held, like stocks and bonds. The Model Penal Code criminalizes theft by unlawful taking of movable property, theft by deception, theft of services, and theft by failure to make required disposition of funds received under one consolidated grading provision (Model Penal Code §§ 223.1, 223.2, 223.3, 223.7, 223.8).</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="storm_1.0-ch11_s01_s01_s01_p02">The act of stealing can be carried out in more than one way. When the defendant steals by a physical <strong class="emphasis bold">taking</strong>, the theft is generally a <strong class="emphasis bold">larceny</strong> theft. The act of taking is twofold. First, the defendant must <strong class="emphasis bold">gain control</strong> over the item. Then the defendant must <strong class="emphasis bold">move</strong> the item, which is called <strong class="emphasis bold">asportation</strong>, as it is with kidnapping.<span class="footnote" id="storm_1.0-fn11_001"><em class="emphasis">Britt v.

Commonwealth</em>, 667 S.E.2d 763 (2008), accessed March 8, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=2834311189194937383&amp;q=larceny+asportation&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2,5&amp;as_ylo=1999">http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=2834311189194937383&amp;q= larceny+asportation&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2,5&amp;as_ylo=1999</a>.</span> Control plus asportation can be accomplished by the defendant’s physical act or by deceiving the victim into transferring the property with a false representation of fact. This is called <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">larceny by trick</a><span class="glossdef">Theft committed by a false representation of fact that results in the defendant’s possession of the stolen personal property.</span></span>. Because larceny requires a physical taking, it generally only pertains to personal property.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="storm_1.0-ch11_s01_s01_s01_p03">Another way for a defendant to steal property is to <strong class="emphasis bold">convert</strong> it to the defendant’s use or ownership. Conversion generally occurs when the victim transfers <em class="emphasis">possession</em> of the property to the defendant, and the defendant thereafter appropriates the property transferred. When the defendant steals by conversion, the theft is generally an <strong class="emphasis bold">embezzlement</strong> theft.<span class="footnote" id="storm_1.0-fn11_003"><em class="emphasis">Commonwealth v. Mills</em>, 436 Mass. 387 (2002), accessed March 7, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=14428947695245966729&amp;q=larceny+false+pretenses+embezzlement&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2,5&amp;as_ylo=1997">http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=14428947695245966729&amp;q= larceny+false+pretenses+embezzlement&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2,5&amp;as_ylo=1997</a>.</span> Embezzlement could occur when the defendant gains possession of property from a friendship or a family relationship or from a paid relationship such as employer-employee or attorney-client. Embezzlement does not require a physical taking, so it can pertain to real or personal property.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="storm_1.0-ch11_s01_s01_s01_p04">When the defendant steals by a false representation of fact, and the subject of the theft is a <strong class="emphasis bold">service</strong>, the theft is generally a <strong class="emphasis bold">false pretenses</strong> theft.<span class="footnote" id="storm_1.0-fn11_004">Cal.

What differentiates false pretenses from larceny by trick is the <strong class="emphasis bold">status</strong> of the property <em class="emphasis">after</em> it is stolen, which is discussed under the harm element of consolidated theft statutes.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="storm_1.0-ch11_s01_s01_s01_p05">To summarize, whether the defendant steals by a physical taking, a conversion, or a false representation of fact, and whether the defendant steals real or personal property or a service, the crime is theft under modern consolidated theft statutes and is graded primarily on the value of the property or service stolen.</p>

                <h2 class="title editable block">Example of Consolidated Theft Act</h2>
                <p class="para editable block" id="storm_1.0-ch11_s01_s01_s01_s01_p01">Jeremy stops by the local convenience store on his way to work and buys some cigarettes. Before paying for the cigarettes, Jeremy slips a package of chewing gum into his pocket and does not pay for it. Jeremy continues walking to his job at a local gas station. When one of the customers buys gas, Jeremy only rings him up for half of the amount purchased. Once the gas station closes, Jeremy takes the other half out of the cash register and puts it in his pocket with the chewing gum. After work, Jeremy decides to have a drink at a nearby bar. While enjoying his drink, he meets a patron named Chuck, who is a taxi driver. Chuck mentions that his taxi needs a tune-up. Jeremy offers to take Chuck back to the gas station and do the tune-up in exchange for a taxi ride home. Chuck eagerly agrees. The two drive to the gas station, and Jeremy suggests that Chuck take a walk around the block while he performs the tune-up. While Chuck is gone, Jeremy lifts the hood of the taxi and then proceeds to read a magazine. When Chuck returns twenty-five minutes later, Jeremy tells him the tune-up is complete. Chuck thereafter drives Jeremy home for free.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="storm_1.0-ch11_s01_s01_s01_s01_p02">In this scenario, Jeremy has performed three separate acts of theft. When Jeremy slips the package of chewing gum into his pocket without paying for it, he has physically <strong class="emphasis bold">taken</strong> personal property, which is a <strong class="emphasis bold">larceny</strong> theft. When Jeremy fails to ring up the entire sale for a customer and pockets the rest from the cash register, he has <strong class="emphasis bold">converted</strong> the owner of the gas station’s cash for his own use, which is an <strong class="emphasis bold">embezzlement</strong> theft. When Jeremy <strong class="emphasis bold">falsely represents</strong> to Chuck that he has performed a tune-up of Chuck’s taxi and receives a free taxi ride in payment, he has falsely represented a fact in exchange for a service, which is a <strong class="emphasis bold">false pretenses</strong> theft. All three of these acts of theft could be prosecuted under <em class="emphasis">one</em> consolidated theft statute. The three stolen items have a relatively low value, so these crimes would probably be graded as a misdemeanor. Grading of theft under consolidated theft statutes is discussed shortly.</p>

The Model Penal Code requires <strong class="emphasis bold">purposeful</strong> intent for theft by unlawful taking, deception, theft of services, and theft by failure to make required disposition of funds received (Model Penal Code §§ 223.2, 223.3, 223.7, 223.8).</p>

                <p class="para editable block" id="storm_1.0-ch11_s01_s01_s02_s01_p01">Jorge goes to the nursery and spends hundreds of dollars on plants for his garden. Some of the plants are delicate and must be put into the ground immediately after purchase. When Jorge gets home, he discovers that he has no shovel because he loaned it to his brother-in-law a few weeks ago. He notices that his neighbor’s shovel is leaning against his neighbor’s garage. If Jorge borrows his neighbor’s shovel so that he can get his expensive plants into the ground, this appropriation would probably <em class="emphasis">not</em> constitute the crime of theft under a consolidated theft statute in certain jurisdictions. Jorge had the intent to perform the theft act of <strong class="emphasis bold">taking</strong> personal property. However, Jorge did not have the specific or purposeful intent to deprive his neighbor of the shovel <em class="emphasis">permanently</em>, which is often required for larceny theft. Thus in this scenario, Jorge may not be charged with and convicted of a consolidated theft offense.</p>

            <ul class="itemizedlist" id="storm_1.0-ch11_s01_s02_l01">
                <li>The criminal act element required for consolidated theft statutes is stealing real or personal property or services. The defendant can commit the theft by a physical taking (larceny), conversion of property in the defendant’s possession (embezzlement), or a false representation of fact (false pretenses or larceny by trick).</li>
                <li>The criminal intent element required for consolidated theft statutes is either specific intent or purposely, or general intent or knowingly to perform the criminal act, depending on the jurisdiction. When the criminal intent is specific or purposely, the defendant must intend the criminal act of stealing and must also intend to keep the stolen property. For false pretenses or larceny by trick theft, in many jurisdictions the defendant must have general intent or knowledge that the representation of fact is false and must make the false representation with the specific intent or purposely to deceive.</li>
                <li>
                    <p class="para">All theft generally requires the attendant circumstances that the property stolen is the property of another, and victim consent to the taking, conversion, or transfer of ownership is lacking.</p>
                    <ul class="itemizedlist" id="storm_1.0-ch11_s01_s02_l02">
                        <li>In many jurisdictions, embezzlement theft under a consolidated theft statute requires the attendant circumstance element of a relationship of trust and confidence between the victim and the defendant.</li>
                        <li>A false pretenses or larceny by trick theft under a consolidated theft statute requires the additional attendant circumstance element of victim reliance on the false representation of fact made by the defendant.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>The harm element required for consolidated theft statutes is the victim’s temporary or permanent loss of property or services, no matter how slight the value. When the defendant gains possession of personal property by a false representation of fact, the theft is larceny by trick theft. When the defendant gains ownership of personal property or possession of money, the theft is false pretenses theft.</li>
                <li>Theft can be graded by degrees or as petty theft, which is theft of property with low value, and grand theft, which is theft of property with significant value. Petty theft or theft of the second or third degree is generally a misdemeanor, while grand theft or theft of the first degree is generally a felony, felony-misdemeanor, or gross misdemeanor, depending on the amount stolen or whether the item stolen is a firearm.</li>
                <li>The criminal act element required for federal mail fraud is the use of the federal postal service to further any scheme to defraud. The criminal intent element required for this offense is general intent, knowingly, or awareness that the postal service will be used. The criminal act supported by the criminal intent must be the factual and legal cause of the harm, which is the placement of anything in a depository or postal office that furthers the scheme to defraud. Federal mail fraud is a felony.</li>

            <ol class="orderedlist" id="storm_1.0-ch11_s01_s02_l03">
                <li>Recall a scenario in <a class="xref" href="storm_1.0-ch01#storm_1.0-ch01">Chapter 1 "Introduction to Criminal Law"</a> where Linda and Clara browse an expensive department store’s lingerie department and Linda surreptitiously places a bra in her purse and leaves the store without paying for it. What type of theft did Linda commit in this scenario?</li>
                <li>Ellen goes to the fine jewelry department at Macy’s and asks the clerk if she can see a Rolex watch, valued at ten thousand dollars. The clerk takes the watch out of the case and lays it on the counter. Ellen tells the clerk that her manager is signaling. When the clerk turns around, Ellen puts her hand over the watch and begins to slide it across the counter and <em class="emphasis">into her open purse</em>. Before the watch slides off the counter, the clerk turns back around and pins Ellen’s hand to the counter, shouting for a security guard. Has Ellen committed a crime in this scenario? If your answer is yes, which crime?</li>
                <li>Read <em class="emphasis">State v. Larson</em>, 605 N.W. 2d 706 (2000). In <em class="emphasis">Larson</em>, the defendant, the owner of an automobile leasing company, was convicted of theft by temporary taking under a consolidated theft statute for failing to return security deposits to customers pursuant to their automobile lease contracts. The defendant appealed, claiming that the lease deposits were not the “property of another.” Did the Supreme Court of Minnesota uphold the defendant’s conviction? Why or why not? The case is available at this link: <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=18374046737925458759&amp;q=embezzlement+%22temporary+taking%22&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2,5">http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=18374046737925458759&amp;q= embezzlement+%22temporary+taking%22&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2,5</a>.</li>
                <li>Read <em class="emphasis">People v. Traster</em>, 111 Cal. App. 4th 1377 (2003). In <em class="emphasis">Traster</em>, the defendant told his employer that it was necessary to purchase computer-licensing agreements, and he was given the employer credit card to purchase them. The defendant thereafter appropriated the money, never purchased the licenses, and quit his job a few days later. The defendant was convicted of theft by false pretenses under a consolidated theft statute. Did the Court of Appeal of California uphold the defendant’s conviction? Why or why not?

                <li>Read <em class="emphasis">U.S. v. Ingles</em>, 445 F.3d 830 (2006). In <em class="emphasis">Ingles</em>, the defendant was convicted of federal mail fraud when his son’s cabin was burned by arson and his son made a claim for homeowner’s insurance. The evidence indicated that the defendant was involved in the arson. The defendant’s son was <strong class="emphasis bold">acquitted</strong> of the arson, and only the insurance company, which sent several letters to the defendant’s son, did the acts of mailing.
