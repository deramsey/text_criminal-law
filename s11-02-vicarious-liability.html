However, vicarious liability should not be confused with accomplice liability. Accomplice liability is based on the defendant’s participation in a criminal enterprise and <strong class="emphasis bold">complicity</strong> with the criminal actor or principal, but vicarious liability transfers a defendant’s criminal responsibility for the crime to a different defendant because of a <em class="emphasis">special relationship</em>. With vicarious liability, the acting defendant also is criminally responsible for his or her conduct. Similar to the civil law concept of respondeat superior discussed in <a class="xref" href="storm_1.0-ch01#storm_1.0-ch01">Chapter 1 "Introduction to Criminal Law"</a>, vicarious liability in criminal law is common between employers and employees.

        <p class="para editable block" id="storm_1.0-ch07_s02_s01_p01">At early common law, corporations were not criminally prosecutable as separate entities, which was most likely because in England, corporations were owned and operated by the government. In modern times, American corporations are private enterprises whose actions can seriously injure other individuals and the economy. Thus a corporation can be criminally responsible for conduct apart from its owners, agents, or employees.<span class="footnote" id="storm_1.0-fn07_016"><em class="emphasis">New York Central R. Co. v.

            <p class="para editable block" id="storm_1.0-ch07_s02_s01_s01_p01">Harry, an employee of Burger King Corporation, shreds corporate documents in his office when Burger King is sued civilly for sexual harassment in a multimillion-dollar class action suit. Under modern theories of corporate liability, both Harry and Burger King could be criminally prosecuted for obstruction of justice. Note that Burger King’s liability is <strong class="emphasis bold">vicarious</strong> and depends on its relationship with Harry as an employer and the fact that Harry is acting within the scope of employment. Vicarious liability is distinguishable from <strong class="emphasis bold">accomplice liability</strong>, where the accomplice must be complicit with the criminal actor. The owners of Burger King, who are the corporate shareholders, did not actively participate in Harry’s conduct, although they will share in the punishment if the corporation is fined.</p>

In addition, other statutes that appear to impose criminal liability vicariously are actually holding individuals responsible for their <em class="emphasis">own</em> criminal conduct. Some examples are statutes holding <strong class="emphasis bold">parents</strong> criminally responsible when their <strong class="emphasis bold">children</strong> commit crimes that involve weapons belonging to the parents, and offenses criminalizing contributing to the delinquency of a minor. In both of these examples, the parents are held accountable for <em class="emphasis">their</em> conduct, such as allowing children to access their guns or be truant from school. The law is evolving in this area because the incidence of juveniles committing crimes is becoming increasingly prevalent.</p>

A child died after falling out of one of the windows.

In <em class="emphasis">Life Care Centers</em>, a resident of the Life Care Center nursing home died in 2004 from injuries sustained when she fell down the front stairs while attempting to leave the facility in her wheelchair. The resident could try to leave the facility because she was not wearing a prescribed security bracelet that both set off an alarm and temporarily locked the front doors if a resident approached within a certain distance of those doors. The defendant, Life Care Centers of America, Inc., a corporation that operates the nursing home, was indicted for involuntary manslaughter and criminal neglect.<span class="footnote" id="storm_1.0-fn07_019">Garrett G.

The evidence indicated that the order requiring the victim to wear a security bracelet was <em class="emphasis">negligently</em> edited out of the victim’s treatment sheet, based on the actions of more than one employee. The individual employee who left the victim near the stairs without the security bracelet relied on the orders that did not indicate a need for the bracelet. There was no evidence that any <em class="emphasis">individual</em> employee of Life Care Centers of America, Inc. was <strong class="emphasis bold">reckless</strong>. The prosecution introduced a theory of “collective knowledge” of the actions or failure to act of the corporation’s employees. The prosecution’s premise was that the several individual instances of negligent conduct combined to create reckless conduct that could be imputed to the corporation vicariously.
