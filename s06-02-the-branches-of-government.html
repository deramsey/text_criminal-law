    <p class="para editable block" id="storm_1.0-ch02_s02_p01">The federal Constitution was written to ensure that government power is distributed and never concentrated in one or more areas. This philosophy is served by <strong class="emphasis bold">federalism</strong>, where the federal government shares power with the states. It is also further served by dividing the government into three branches, all responsible for different government duties and all <em class="emphasis">checking and balancing</em> each other. The three branches of government are detailed in Articles I–III of the federal Constitution and are the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">legislative branch</a><span class="glossdef">The branch of government responsible for creating statutory law.</span></span>, the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">executive branch</a><span class="glossdef">The branch of government responsible for enforcing statutory law.</span></span>, and the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">judicial branch</a><span class="glossdef">The branch of government responsible for interpreting statutory and constitutional law(s).</span></span>. While the federal Constitution identifies only the federal branches of government, the principle of checks and balances applies to the states as well. Most states identify the three state branches of government in their state constitution.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="storm_1.0-ch02_s02_p02">Each branch of government has a distinct authority. When one branch encroaches on the duties of another, this is called a violation of <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">separation of powers</a><span class="glossdef">Each government branch must act only within the scope set forth in the Constitution.</span></span>. The <em class="emphasis">courts</em> decide whether a government branch has overstepped its boundaries because courts interpret the Constitution, which describes each branch’s sphere of influence. Thus the judicial branch, which consists of all the courts, retains the balance of power.</p>
    <div class="section" id="storm_1.0-ch02_s02_s01">
        <h2 class="title editable block">The Legislative Branch</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="storm_1.0-ch02_s02_s01_p01">The <strong class="emphasis bold">legislative branch</strong> is responsible for creating statutory laws. Citizens of a state can vote for some state statutes by ballot, but the <strong class="emphasis bold">federal legislative branch</strong> enacts all federal statutes. In the federal government, the legislative branch is headed by Congress. States’ legislative branches are headed by a state legislature. Congress is <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">bicameral</a><span class="glossdef">Made up of two houses.</span></span>, which means it is made up of two houses. This system provides equal representation among the several states and by citizens of the United States. States are represented by the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Senate</a><span class="glossdef">The house of Congress responsible for representing each state.</span></span>. Every state, no matter how large or small, gets two senators. Citizens are represented by the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">House of Representatives</a><span class="glossdef">The house of Congress responsible for representing each citizen of the United States.</span></span>. Membership in the House of Representatives is based on population. A heavily populated state, like California, has more representatives than a sparsely populated state, like Alaska. States’ legislatures are generally bicameral and have a similar structure to the federal system.</p>

Congress can impeach the president of the United States, which is the first step toward removal from office. Congress can also enact statutes that supersede judicial opinions, as discussed in <a class="xref" href="storm_1.0-ch01#storm_1.0-ch01">Chapter 1 "Introduction to Criminal Law"</a>. Similarly, state legislature can also impeach a governor or enact a state statute that supersedes a state case law.</p>

The president of the United States can veto statutes proposed by Congress. The president also has the authority to nominate federal justices and judges, who thereafter serve for life. State executive branches have similar check and balancing authority; a governor can generally veto statutes proposed by state legislature and can appoint some state justices and judges.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">The Judicial Branch</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="storm_1.0-ch02_s02_s03_p01">The <strong class="emphasis bold">judicial branch</strong> is responsible for interpreting all laws, including statutes, codes, ordinances, and the federal and state constitutions. This power is all encompassing and is the basis for <strong class="emphasis bold">judicial review</strong>, referenced in <a class="xref" href="storm_1.0-ch01#storm_1.0-ch01">Chapter 1 "Introduction to Criminal Law"</a>. It allows the judicial branch to invalidate any unconstitutional law in the statutory source of law and also to change the federal and state constitutions by interpretation. For example, when a court creates an exception to an amendment to the constitution, it has made an informal change without the necessity of a national or state consensus. The federal judicial branch is headed by the US Supreme Court. Each state’s judicial branch is headed by the highest-level state appellate court. Members of the judicial branch include all judges and justices of every federal and state court in the court system, which is discussed shortly.</p>

The US Supreme Court can invalidate statutes enacted by Congress if they conflict with the Constitution. The US Supreme Court can also prevent the president from taking action if that action violates separation of powers. The state courts can likewise nullify unconstitutional statutes passed by the state legislature and void other executive branch actions that are unconstitutional.</p>

                    <li>Read <em class="emphasis">Youngstown Sheet &amp; Tube Co. v. Sawyer</em>, 343 U.S. 579 (1952). In <em class="emphasis">Youngstown</em>, President Truman seized control of steel mills to avert a strike, using his authority as commander in chief of the armed forces. President Truman wanted to ensure steel production during the Korean War. Did the US Supreme Court uphold President Truman’s action? Why or why not?
