Thus although a jury convicted the defendant after viewing the film, the Court reversed the conviction, stating that the film does not constitute the hard-core pornography that the three-part test for obscenity isolates from the First Amendment’s protection. The Court stated, “Appellant’s showing of the film ‘Carnal Knowledge’ is simply not the ‘public portrayal of hard core sexual conduct for its own sake, and for the ensuing commercial gain’ which we said was punishable in <em class="emphasis">Miller</em>, Id., at 35.”<span class="footnote" id="storm_1.0-fn03_030"><em class="emphasis">Jenkins v.

                    <p class="para" id="storm_1.0-ch03_s03_s01_s05_s02_p02">Congress enacted 18 U.S.C. § 48, which criminalizes commercial creation, sale, or possession of a visual or auditory depiction in which a living animal is intentionally maimed, mutilated, tortured, wounded, or killed, if that conduct violates federal or state law where the creation, sale, or possession takes place. In <em class="emphasis">United States v. Stevens</em>, 552 U.S. 442 (2010), the US Supreme Court held that this statute is <em class="emphasis">facially overbroad</em> and violative of the <em class="emphasis">First Amendment</em>. Specifically, the Court held that depictions of animal cruelty are entitled to First Amendment protection, and the statute is <em class="emphasis">presumptively invalid</em> because it is <em class="emphasis">content based</em>. In addition, the Court stated that the government’s interest in censoring this type of material is not compelling enough to outweigh the prohibition on protected speech and that the statute on its face included material that may have redeeming social value.

                        <li>Speech under the First Amendment is any form of expression, such as verbal or written words, pictures, videos, and songs. Expressive conduct, such as dressing a certain way, flag burning, and cross burning, is also considered First Amendment speech.</li>
                        <li>Five types of speech that can be governmentally regulated are fighting words, incitement to riot, hate speech, obscenity, and nude dancing.</li>
                        <li>Statutes that prohibit fighting words and incitement to riot must be narrowly drafted to include only speech that incites imminent unlawful action, not future harm or general advocacy. Statutes that prohibit hate speech must be narrowly drafted to include only speech that is supported by the intent to intimidate. Statutes that prohibit obscenity must target speech that appeals to a prurient interest in sex, depicts sexual conduct in a patently offensive way, and has little or no literary, artistic, political, or scientific value. Nude dancing can be regulated as long as the regulation is reasonable, such as requiring dancers to wear pasties and a g-string.</li>

                        <li>A state statute enhances the penalty for battery if the crime is committed “because of the victim’s race.” To prove race-biased intent, it is frequently necessary to admit evidence of the defendant’s statements indicating racial hatred and intolerance. Does this statute violate the First Amendment’s free speech protection? Why or why not? Read the case on which this question is based, <em class="emphasis">Wisconsin v. Mitchell</em>, 508 U.S. 47 (1993).
