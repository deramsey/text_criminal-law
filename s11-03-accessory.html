            <p class="para editable block" id="storm_1.0-ch07_s03_s01_s01_p01">Jim wakes up late at night to the sound of someone pounding on his door. He gets out of bed, walks down the stairs, and opens the door. His father James is on the doorstep. James’s eyes are bloodshot and he is swaying slightly on his feet. He tells Jim that he just got into a car accident and needs to come inside before the police find out about it and begin an investigation. Jim steps aside and lets his father enter the house. The smell of alcohol on his father’s breath is apparent. He thereafter allows his father to spend the night without contacting the police about the accident.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="storm_1.0-ch07_s03_s01_s01_p02">Jim has probably committed the <strong class="emphasis bold">criminal act</strong> element required for an accessory in many jurisdictions. Jim allowed his father to <em class="emphasis">escape arrest</em> and <em class="emphasis">evade</em> an alcohol screening after leaving the scene of a car accident, which is most likely <strong class="emphasis bold">felony</strong> drunk driving and hit and run. He also sheltered his father for the night, <em class="emphasis">concealing</em> him from law enforcement. If Jim is in a state that exempts family members from accessory liability, he may not be subject to prosecution because the principal to the crime(s) is his father. If Jim is not in a state that relieves family members from accessory liability, he could be fully prosecuted for and convicted of this offense.</p>

                <li>Cory watches as her sister Amanda breaks into a parking meter across the street and starts scooping change into her purse. Amanda thereafter runs into a nearby alley and hides behind a dumpster. A police officer arrives on the scene and asks Cory if she witnessed the crime. Cory responds, “No, I didn’t notice anything.” The police officer does a search, does not find Amanda, and leaves. Has Cory committed a crime?

                <li>Read <em class="emphasis">U.S. v. Hill</em>, 268 F.3d 1140 (2001). In <em class="emphasis">Hill</em>, the defendant was convicted of harboring a fugitive and being an accessory when she helped her husband escape the country to avoid prosecution for a failure to pay child support. The defendant claimed that her convictions were unconstitutional because they contravened her right to privacy, association, marriage, and due process. Did the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit uphold the defendant’s convictions? The case is available at this link: <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-9th-circuit/1215479.html">http://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-9th-circuit/1215479.html</a>.</li>

In <em class="emphasis">Truesdell</em>, the prosecution appealed the dismissal of the defendant’s case that was a prosecution for accessory to her twelve-year-old son’s felony shooting of her ex-husband. The lower court held that the defendant could not be an accessory to a felony because her son was not an adult who could be charged with a felony. Did the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals reverse the lower court and permit the defendant to be tried as an accessory? Why or why not?
